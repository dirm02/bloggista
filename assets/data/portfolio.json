Common reasons to convert images to text are if you want to google it, store it, email it or translate it. Until now, your only option was to retype the text. For language learners and Manga readers There are many translator addons available, but they only work with plain website text.

I tested it with 0.6 mm, but later saw a white paper from USB IF using 0.8 mm for a similar fully featured connector. This footprint is optimized to get the best of both worlds between following the spec and DFM. For example, the dogbone cutouts allow the right dimention at the tip of the plug, adding some much needed support. The slot width is made with PCB edge routing tolerance in mind, and silkscreen adds a layer of protection against the small ground pins found on the inner tip of plugs. Add a thin layer of metal on both sides to get the silkscreen area to 1.2 mm thick to better support and strengthen the connector. Testing and usec"

Everything you write with Grammarly is sent to their servers. Their privacy policy claims they don't sell the data, but that doesn't mean they don't use it to train large language models and god knows what else. Not only that, but the round-trip-time of the network request makes revising your work all the more tedious. LanguageTool is great, if you have gigabytes of RAM to spare and are willing to download the 16GB n-gram dataset. Besides the memory requirements, I found LanguageTool too slow: it would take several seconds to lint even a moderate-size document.

Remember that you read the code much more often than you write it. - Maintainability : Sorting imports and properties is considered a good practice in software development, contributing to code quality and consistency across the codebase. - Code Review and Collaboration : If you set rules that say you can only do things one way, no one will have to spend time thinking about how to do it. - Code Uniformity : When all code looks exactly the same, it is very hard to see who wrote it, which makes"

It also supports instant file sharing with multiple devices at once which many file sharing apps lack. Blaze primarily uses WebTorrent and WebSockets protocol (as a fallback) to transfer files between multiple devices. Files shared via WebTorrent are peer-to-peer (as they use WebRTC internally) which means there is direct transfer between the sender and receiver without any intermediate server . Do note that tracker servers in WebTorrent are used which carry metadata and facilitate the file transfer but do not get the complete file in any form.

I found that after we hit a certain size (around 500K monthly active users), the flood of these bad actors became entirely unmanagable. I tried countless detection methods, but most of them resulted in too many missed and/or false positives. I tried offloading the account creation process to depend on the user having a Facebook profile, thinking that would solve the problem. It didn't help at all. Next I tried Google sign-in, but it also was entirely ineffective. I eventually tried to outsource the problem to a company called MaxMind.

All important LoRa parameters can be configured, including frequency , bandwidth , spread factor , crc , preamble length , power amplification , and implicit/explicit header . 4 methods of operation are supported, but only 2 are currently implemented: - Transmit only mode (implemented) - Continuous receive mode (implemented) - RX/TX mode (not implemented) - Single receive mode (not implemented) The library exposes 4 key functions: - sx127x start rx -- put the module into continuous receive mode - sx127x schedule tx -- add a packet to the internal ring buffer"

Stagehand is a browser automation framework used to control web browsers with natural language and code. By combining the power of AI with the precision of code, Stagehand makes web automation flexible, maintainable, and actually reliable. Why Stagehand? Most existing browser automation tools either require you to write low-level code in a framework like Selenium, Playwright, or Puppeteer, or use high-level agents that can be unpredictable in production. By letting developers choose what to write in code vs. natural language (and bridging the gap between the two) Stagehand is the natural choice for browser automations in production. 1. Choose when to write code vs. natural language : use AI when you want to navigate unfamiliar pages, and use code when you know exactly what you want to do. 2. Go from AI-driven to rep"

We study the problem from a physical and topological perspective: a 3D line most naturally emerges as the edge of a finite 3D planar patch. We present LiP-Map, a line–plane joint optimization framework that explicitly models learnable line and planar primitives. This coupling enables accurate and detailed 3D line mapping while maintaining strong efficiency (typically completing a reconstruction in 3 to 5 minutes per scene). LiP-Map pioneers the integration of planar topology into 3D line mapping, not by imposing pairwise coplanarity constraints but by explicitly constructing interactions between plane and line primitives, thus offering a principled route toward structured reconstruction in man-ma"

Our method reconstructs individual objects and the surrounding background as textured 3D assets, enabling coherent scene assembly from minimal input. We combine instance segmentation, context-aware generative inpainting, 2D-to-3D asset creation, and constrained optimization to recover physically plausible geometry, materials, and lighting. The resulting scenes preserve correct spatial relationships, lighting consistency, and material fidelity, making them suitable for production-ready workflows.

It combines selective bit depth, color type, and color palette reduction with zopfli DEFLATE compression algorithm encoding using the pngquant and zopflipng PNG optimization tools. This approach leads to a significant file size gain relative to lossless approaches at the expense of a relatively modest decrease in image quality (see example images below).

To address this issue, we introduce the high-frequency components of the reference sample to enhance the extraction of handwriting style. The proposed style-enhanced module can effectively capture the writing style patterns and suppress the interference of background noise. - Extensive experiments on handwriting datasets in English, Chinese, and Japanese demonstrate that our approach with a single style reference even outperforms previous methods with 15x-more references.

I found the Kingbright AM2520P3BT03 IR phototransistors and wavelength-matched ON Semiconductor QEB363ZR IR LEDs.

It's about asking, 'Why not?'\" - Cave Johnson GLaDOS is the AI antagonist from Valve's Portal series—a sardonic, passive-aggressive superintelligence who views humans as test subjects worthy of both study and mockery. Back in 2022 when ChatGPT made its debut, I had a realization: we are living in the Sci-Fi future and can actually build her now. A demented, obsessive AI fixated on humanity, super intelligent yet utterly lacking sound judgment; so just like an LLM, right? 2026, and still no moon colonies or flying cars. But a passive-aggressive AI that controls your lights and runs experiments on you? That we can do. The architecture borrows from Minsky's Society of Mind—rather than one monolithic prompt, multiple specialized agents (vision, memory, personality, planning) each contribute to a dynamic context. GLaDOS's \"self\" emerges from their combined output, assembled fresh for each interaction. The hard part was latenc"

The proxy automatically detects what protocol is being used by each client. Installation Option 1: precompiled x86 64 binary Debian packages, archives for Linux and Windows can be downloaded here. Nothing else has to be installed. The server doesn't require any external dependencies. In the Debian package, the example configuration file can be found in /usr/share/doc/encrypted-dns/ . Option 2: compilation from source code The proxy requires rust = 1.0.39 or rust-nightly. Rust can installed with: sh curl -sSf bash -s -- -y --default-toolchain nightly source $HOME/.cargo/env Once rust is installed, the proxy can be compiled and installed as follows: sh cargo install encrypted-dns strip /.cargo/bi"

Motivation So why another open-source 3D CAD application when FreeCAD and Solvespace exist? My primary use case for 3D CAD is designing 3D-printed enclosures for my electronics projects. I often found myself procrastinating designing the enclosure and attributed that to my dissatisfaction with the available open source 3D CAD applications. While FreeCAD technically does everything I need, the way it's implemented isn't quite to my liking. My biggest pain points with it are the modal sketcher that only works in 2D, no constraints in 3D for extrusions and the perils of referencing things in the design. Solvespace on the other hand gets the workflow part right, but falls short by not importing STEP and the geometry kernel not supporting chamfers and fillets.

Nowadays, the most widespread protocol is http and is de facto allowed by third party equipment. Wstunnel uses the websocket protocol which is compatible with http in order to bypass firewalls and proxies. Wstunnel allows you to tunnel whatever traffic you want and access whatever resources/site you need.

Each modality’s augmentations are contained within its own sub-library. These sub-libraries include both function-based and class-based transforms, composition operators, and have the option to provide metadata about the transform applied, including its intensity. AugLy is a great library to utilize for augmenting your data in model training, or to evaluate the robustness gaps of your model! We designed AugLy to include many specific data augmentations that users perform in real life on internet platforms like Facebook's -- for example making an image into a meme, overlaying text/emojis on images/videos, reposting a screenshot from social media. While AugLy contains more generic data augmentations as well, it will be particularly useful to you if you're working on a problem like copy detection, hate speech detection, or copyright "

You can apply a fixed voltage offset to one of 5 voltage planes, override your systems temperature target (CPU will throttle when this temperature is reached), and adjust the system's short and long power budgets (clocks and thus voltages will be altered in order to keep total power usage in these periods under the configured limits). For more information, read here . Installing ---------- From PyPi:: $ pip install undervolt From source:: $ pip install git+ Note for custom kernel users: the module 'msr' (\"CONFIG X86 MSR\") must be enabled in the kernel options (Processor type & features - Model-specific register support) Examples --"

It implements a simple FSK-based transmission protocol that can be easily integrated in various projects. The bandwidth rate is between 8-16 bytes/sec depending on the protocol parameters. Error correction codes (ECC) are used to improve demodulation robustness. This library is used only to generate and analyze the RAW waveforms that are played and captured from your audio devices (speakers, microphones, etc.). You are free to use any audio backend (e.g. PulseAudio, ALSA, etc.) as long as you provide callbacks for queuing and dequeuing audio samples.

Unlike existing vision-language models (VLMs), which struggle with geometric reasoning, our approach generates smooth video trajectories via a diffusion process constrained by known camera poses and integrates this information into the VLM for 3D-grounded descriptions. We synthesize the final video using 3D Gaussian splatting to render novel views along the trajectory. To support this task, we present the HouseTour dataset, which includes over 1,200 house-tour videos with camera poses, 3D reconstructions, and real estate descriptions. Experiments"

But even the fallback block display is usable. Displays regular images, plays animated gifs, scrolls static images and plays videos. Useful if you want to have a quick visual check without leaving the comfort of your shell and having to start a bulky image viewer. Sometimes this is the only way if your terminal is connected remotely via ssh. And of course if you don't need the resolution.

A patch applied to the OpenSSH v7.5p1 source code causes it to act as a proxy between the victim and their intended SSH server; all plaintext passwords and sessions are logged to disk. Of course, the victim's SSH client will complain that the server's key has changed. But because 99.99999% of the time this is caused by a legitimate action (OS re-install, configuration change, etc), many/most users will disregard the warning and continue on. NOTE: Only run the modified sshd mitm in a VM or container! Ad-hoc edits were made to the OpenSSH sources in critical regions, with no regard to their security implications. Its not hard to imagine these edits introduce serious vulnerabilities. Change Log v2.3: ???: Added support for Linux Mint 20 & Ubuntu 20. v2.2: September 16, 2019: Fixed installation on Kali & Linux Mint 19. Fixed a double-password prompt "

It provides a set of hooks that enables you to build your React applications faster. The hooks are built upon the principles of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). There are hooks for most common use cases you might need. The library is designed to be as minimal as possible. It is fully tree-shakable (using the ESM version), meaning that you only import the hooks you need, and the rest will be removed from your bundle making the cost of using this library negligible. Most hooks are extensively tested and are being used in production environments. Usage example tsx import { useLocalStorage } from 'usehooks-ts' function Component() { const [value, setValue] = useLocalStorage('my-localStorage-key', 0) // ... } 🪝 Available Hooks - useBoo"

MemR3 transforms retrieval into a closed-loop process: a router dynamically switches between Retrieve, Reflect, and Answer nodes while a global evidence–gap tracker maintains what is known and what is still missing. This enables iterative query refinement, targeted retrieval, and early stopping, making MemR3 an autonomous, backend-agnostic retrieval controller.

Root Cause: When both the host and federated modules bundle Tailwind CSS independently, CSS cascade layer conflicts occur. This leads to unpredictable style overrides across module boundaries, breaking responsive utilities (for example flex md:grid ) and causing module styles to unintentionally override host styles. This issue is inherent to utility-driven global CSS in a module federation environment and cannot be reliably mitigated with configuration alone. Resolution Direction: PR 93 introduces an enhanced version of the internal UI library designed to replace Tailwind entirely . The new system is token-driven, component-based, and avoids global utility CSS, eliminating cross-boundary cascade conflicts by design. This change establishes a single, predictable styling contract "

The problem: CV maintenance is tedious. Every job application means copying content, adjusting formatting, and hoping you didn't break the layout. Version control is an afterthought. Tailoring for ATS systems feels like guesswork. The solution: Treat your CV like code. LaTeX provides the structure. Coding agents provide the intelligence. Git provides the history. You provide the direction. The kicker: You're probably already paying for a coding agent subscription. Why not squeeze more value out of it?

SSH-Snake can automatically reveal the relationship between systems which are connected via SSH, which would normally take a tremendous amount of time and effort to perform manually. In other words, SSH-Snake performs the following tasks automatically and recursively: 1. On the current system, find any SSH private keys, 2. On the current system, find any hosts or destinations ( user@host ) that the private keys may be accepted, 3. Attempt to SSH into all of the destinations using all of the private keys discovered, 4.

The environment variables and filesystem are all configured to match what GitHub provides. - Local Task Runner - I love make. However, I also hate repeating myself.

Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance . To this end, we propose FlashVSR , the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at ∼17 FPS for 768 × 1408 videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attentio"

This service programs automatic rtcwake calls in the near future and safely powers down the laptop if AC fails. If present, it will safely and/or forcefully power off RAID HDDs to prevent mechanical wear. It will attempt to boot once power is restored, after a specified waiting time. Note that in principle it should work even if AC power takes longer to restore. If the system has no battery at all, it will simply power off (obviously) and it will try to boot automatically later. This method is not ideal and may fail if the BIOS CMOS battery is too old or empty. This should be considered as a last-resort option for old devices without WOL nor automatic BIOS wake support.

    "indexed_content": "LearnGitBranching LearnGitBranching is a git repository visualizer, sandbox, and a series of educational tutorials and challenges. Its primary purpose is to help developers understand git through the power of visualization (something that's absent when working on the command line). This is achieved through a game with different levels to get acquainted with the different git commands. You can input a variety of commands into LearnGitBranching (LGB) -- as commands are processed, the nearby commit tree will dynamically update to reflect the effects of each command: This visualization combined with tutorials and \"levels\" can help both beginners and intermediate developers polish their version control skills. A quick demo is available here: Or, you can launch the application normally here: Sandbox Mode By default the application launches in \"sandbox mode\" with a basic repository already created. Here you can enter commands and mess around with a repository as much as you like. Keep in mind"

Purpose witr exists to answer a single question: Why is this running? When something is running on a system, whether it is a process, a service, or something bound to a port, there is always a cause. That cause is often indirect, non-obvious, or spread across multiple layers such as supervisors, containers, services, or shells. Existing tools ( ps , top , lsof , ss , systemctl , docker ps ) expose state and metadata. They show what is running, but leave the user to infer why by manually correlating outputs across tools. witr makes that causality explicit. It explains where a running thing came from , how it was started , and what chain of systems is responsible for it existing right now , in a single, human-readable output. --- 2.

The generated file allows you to add your own code to each function exported from the original DLL without disrupting the normal operation of the program. No reverse engineering or instrumentation is required, because DllShimmer does not rely on function signatures (see more in “Limitations”).

We have also distilled the speech-token-to-mel decoder, previously a bottleneck, reducing generation from 10 steps to just one , while retaining high-fidelity audio output. Paralinguistic tags are now native to the Turbo model, allowing you to use [cough] , [laugh] , [chuckle] , and more to add distinct realism. While Turbo was built primarily for low-latency voice agents, it excels at narration and creative workflows. If you like the model but need to scale or tune it for higher accuracy, check out our competitively priced TTS service ( link ). It delivers reliable performance with ultra-low latency of sub 200ms—ideal for production use in age"

When in doubt, try one of those features -- features that support widespread scanning of many machines are supported, while in-depth scanning of single machines aren't. Internally, it uses asynchronous transmission, similar to port scanners like scanrand , unicornscan , and ZMap . It's more flexible, allowing arbitrary port and address ranges. NOTE: masscan uses its own ad hoc TCP/IP stack . Anything other than simple port scans may cause conflict with the local TCP/IP stack.

A modern face recognition pipeline consists of 5 common stages: detect, align, normalize, represent and verify. While DeepFace handles all these common stages in the background, you don’t need to acquire in-depth knowledge about all the processes behind it. You can just call its verification, find or analysis function with a single line of code. Experiments show that human beings have 97.53% accuracy on facial recognition tasks whereas those models already reached and passed that accuracy level.

It is capable of normalizing natural language search queries, auto-completing a search query and providing the most relevant results for a query. Sonic is an identifier index, rather than a document index; when queried, it returns IDs that can then be used to refer to the matched documents in an external database. A strong attention to performance and code cleanliness has been given when designing Sonic. It aims at being crash-free, super-fast and puts minimum strain on server resources (our measurements have shown that Sonic - when under load - responds to search queries in the μs range, eats 30MB RAM and has a low CPU footprint; see our benchmarks).

No more relying on online services for video compression, or the manual trial-and-error of re-encoding at various bitrates yourself. Features include: - An intuitive, easy to use interface. - Automatic calculation of average bitrate (ABR), resolution, framerate, and audio quality each video is re-encoded with to meet the target file size. - Bulk compression of multiple videos to one output directory. - Customization of framerate limits, to ensure a clearer or smoother image. - A choice of codecs to encode output files with, including H.264, HEVC, AV1, and VP9. The app attempts to retain as much audiovisual quality as possible for the file size given. However, extremely steep reductions in file size can cause significant loss of quality in the output file, and sometimes compression may not be possible at all. All pro"

The business end of things didn't work out, and so they stopped developing the app in mid-2023. After spending nearly $1 million on development (employees, contractors, data providers, infra, etc.), the team open-sourced the app. Their goal was to let users self-host it for free — and eventually launch a hosted version for a small fee. They actually did launch that hosted version … briefly. That also didn’t work out — at least not as a sustainable B2C business — so now here"

It takes care of the complex migration operations to ensure that client applications continue working while the database schema is being updated. This includes ensuring changes are applied without locking the database, and that both old and new schema versions work simultaneously (even when breaking changes are being made!). This removes risks related to schema migrations, and greatly simplifies client application rollout, also allowing for instant rollbacks. See the introductory blog post for more about the problems solved by pgroll . Features - Zero-downtime migrations (no database locking, no breaking changes). - Keep old and new schema versions working simultaneously. - Automatic columns backfilling when needed. - Ins"

Older macOS versions are not supported due to Tauri 2's WKWebView requirements. --- ✨ Motivation As a software engineer and maker hobbyist, I love OpenSCAD. It allows for precision and maps to my mental model of building things. However, some operations (like rounding with minkowski ) are not very intuitive. At work, I often use Cursor and Claude Code for writing code, and found myself plugging my OpenSCAD code into ChatGPT in order to either (1) scaffold out a starting point or (2) fix a confusing issue in my code. I also became frustrated by certain limitations of the OpenSCAD editor, like not being able to easily indent code with the editor commands I'm used to. So I built OpenSCAD S"

The conditioning setup also allows for fine control over speaking rate, pitch variation, audio quality, and emotions such as happiness, fear, sadness, and anger. The model outputs speech natively at 44kHz.
