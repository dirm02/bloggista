## 🌟 Features

- 🚀 **Skip Intro / Credits Support**: Lets you quickly skip intros and credits during playback
- 🖼️ **Trickplay images**: The new golden standard for chapter previews when seeking

## 🧪 Experimental Features

Streamyfin offers exciting experimental features such as media downloading and Chromecast support. These features are under active development, and your feedback and patience help us make them even better.

### 📥 Downloading

Downloading works by using FFmpeg to convert an HLS stream into a video file on your device. This lets you download and watch any content that you can stream. The conversion is handled in real time by Jellyfin on the server during the download. While this may take a bit longer, it ensures compatibility with any file your server can transcode.

### 🧩 Streamyfin Plugin

The Jellyfin Plugin for Streamyfin is a plugin you install into Jellyfin that holds all settings for the client Streamyfin. This allows you to synchronize settings across all your users, like for example:

- Automatic Seerr login with no user input required
- Set your preferred default languages
- Configure download method and search provider
- Personalize your home screen
- And much more

### 📡 Chromecast

Chromecast support is currently under development. Video casting is already available, and we're actively working on adding subtitle support and additional features.

### 🎬 MPV Player

Streamyfin uses [MPV](https://mpv.io/) as its primary video player on all platforms, powered by [MPVKit](https://github.com/mpvkit/MPVKit). MPV is a powerful, open-source media player known for its wide format support and high-quality playback.
Thanks to [@Alexk2309](https://github.com/Alexk2309) for the hard work building the native MPV module in Streamyfin.

### 🔍 Jellysearch

[Jellysearch](https://gitlab.com/DomiStyle/jellysearch) works with Streamyfin

> A fast full-text search proxy for Jellyfin. Integrates seamlessly with most Jellyfin clients.

### 🧪 Beta Testing

To access the Streamyfin beta, you need to subscribe to the Member tier (or higher) on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/streamyfin). This grants you immediate access to the ⁠🧪-beta-releases channel on Discord and lets me know you’ve subscribed. This is where I share APKs and IPAs. It does not provide automatic TestFlight access, so please send me a DM (Cagemaster) with the email you use for Apple so we can add you manually.

**Note**: Anyone actively contributing to Streamyfin’s source code will receive automatic access to beta releases.

## 🚀 Getting Started

- Your device is on the same network as the Jellyfin server (for local connections)  
- Your Jellyfin server is up and running with remote access enabled if you plan to connect from outside your local network  
- Your server version is up to date (older versions may cause compatibility issues)  
- You have a valid Jellyfin user account with access to the media libraries you want to view  
- If using features such as **downloads** or **Seerr integration**, confirm the required plugins are installed and configured on your Jellyfin server

3. Make sure you have xcode and/or android studio installed. (follow the guides for expo: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
   - If iOS builds fail with `missing Metal Toolchain` (KSPlayer shaders), run `npm run ios:install-metal-toolchain` once
4. Install BiomeJS extension in VSCode/Your IDE (https://biomejs.dev/)
4. run `npm run prebuild`
5. Create an expo dev build by running `npm run ios` or `npm run android`. This will open a simulator on your computer and run the app

For the TV version suffix the npm commands with `:tv`.

`npm run prebuild:tv`  
`npm run ios:tv or npm run android:tv`
