  [](https://github.com/AndnixSH/APKToolGUI/releases) GUI for apktool, signapk, zipalign
  and baksmali utilities. It is a tool for reverse engineering 3rd party, closed,
  binary Android apps. It can decode resources to nearly original form and rebuild
  them after making some modifications; it makes possible to debug smali code step
  by step. Also it makes working with app easier because of project-like files structure
  and automation of some repetitive tasks like building apk, etc. # Download links
  https://github.com/AndnixSH/APKToolGUI/releases Any alert from your antivirus regarding
  this application is a **false positive**, caused by how the application operates.
  To resolve this, manually add **APKToolGUI.exe** to your antivirus’s whitelist or
  exclusion list. If you remain unsure, you can compile the app yourself or refrain
  from using it until you confirm its safety with your antivirus provider. # Requirements
  - Windows 7 32-bit/64-bit and above - [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) or [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
  8 or above. Using latest JDK is not really necessary. Java 8 and 17 (long-term support
  release) is enough. Use 64-bit version if your system is 64-bit - [.NET Framework
  4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48) (Windows
  8 and above already have it preinstalled) # Features - Decompile & compile APK using
  Apktool - Decompile APK/XAPK/APKS/ZIP/APKM & compile APK using APKEditor.jar. Automatically
  detect if APK was decompiled using Apktool or APKEditor - Merge XAPK/APKS/ZIP/APKM
  using APKEditor.jar - Sign APK - Zipalign APK - ADB - Framework - Drag and drop
  - APK info - Log output - All other features from [Apktool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/documentation/).
  - Fix some Apktool errors, such as removing DUMMY_APKTOOL, clear framework before
  decompiling - Multi language - Right-click context menu - Create unsigned APK for
  Core Patch - High DPI support - Long path support (Windows 10 and above) # Languages
  - English - Brazilian Portuguese (Incomplete) - Hungary (Incomplete) - Russian (Incomplete)
  - Chinese Simplified (Incomplete) - German ### Translation If you like to help translate
  with your native language, I recommend using Visual Studio 2022. You don't need
  any programming knowledge, you just edit the GUI and the `.resx` files Create new
  `.resx` file under `Languages` folder, and `Forms/FormXXX.cs/`. To create a new
  `.resx` under `Forms/FormXXX.cs/`, open the form and select the form to show the
  properties. In the properties, scroll down until you see Language, and select any
  language you would like to translate. Video tutorial https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40742924/227244601-6f796141-ac2d-4c60-b5cd-7f6872604cd7.mp4
  If you can't use Visual Studio, you can use translator tools like [resxtranslator](https://github.com/HakanL/resxtranslator)
  or [RESX Translator automat](https://www.utilstudio.com/en/resx-translator/), but
  make sure the `.resx` file is added to [APKToolGUI.csproj](https://github.com/AndnixSH/APKToolGUI/blob/master/APKToolGUI/APKToolGUI.csproj),
  otherwise Visual Studio would not be able to detect it 3rd party tools can't be
  translated. Make pull request when you are done # Issues Issues with Apktool? Please

##### Can you help me with modding APKs in general?
No, I do not provide support for APK modding.

##### Can you make an automatic APK injecting tool?
No, I'm not interested.

##### Can you implement APK to AAB conversion?
No, APKTool is designed for decompiling and recompiling APKs, not for converting between formats. AAB (Android App Bundle) is used exclusively for distributing apps on the Google Play Store and is not directly installable on devices.

If you need to convert an APK to AAB, you can try using a tool like [APK2AAB](https://github.com/sensei-z/APK2AAB)

##### Can you implement features to protect, pack, or obfuscate APKs?
No, APK protection is beyond the scope of this tool.

##### Can you implement features to deobfuscate, unpack APKs, or bypass anti-cheat/security?
No, these features are also beyond the scope of this tool. I do not support or condone bypassing such protections.
