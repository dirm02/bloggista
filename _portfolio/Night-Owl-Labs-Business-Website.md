  Story I wanted to create a **Business Website** that was easy to setup and use,
  while also being fully customizable, and I think I've done just that. This project
  is a culmination of my experience as a software developer and my passion for creating
  useful applications. ## Getting Started ### Installation & Set Up 1. Install the
  Gatsby CLI ```sh npm install -g gatsby-cli ``` 2. Run the development server ```sh
  gastby develop ``` 3. View the website at `http://localhost:8000` ### Building and
  Running for Production 1. Generate a full static production build ```sh gatsby build
  ``` 2. Preview the site as it will appear once deployed ```sh gatsby serve ``` 3.
  View the website at `http://localhost:9000` 4. Commit to GitHub 5. Create a new
  site on Netlify 6. Connect your GitHub account 7. Select your repository 8. Click
  `Deploy Site` 9. View your website at `https:// .netlify.app` 10. Optionally, you
  can also setup a custom domain name for your website ### Configuration You can easily
  configure this website to your liking by following the steps below, changing it
  from a full website to a preview landing page for your product or app: 1. Open the
  `src/components/config.js` file 2. Update the `config` object with your information
  ```js export const CONFIG = { showLandingPage: false, // Set to false to hide the
  landing page showHeader: true, // Set to false to hide the header showFooter: true,
  // Set to false to hide the footer }; ``` 3. If you decide to use the app landing
  page, open the `src/components/landing.js` file to edit it and use the `static/images/landing`
  directory to store your images. 4. Optionally, you can also adjust the amount of
  time the up arrow is displayed before fading out by adjusting the `newTimeout` value
  in the `src/components/layout.js` file. ```js // Set a new timeout const newTimeout
  = setTimeout(() => { setShowScroll(false) }, 7000) // Hide button 7 seconds after
  scrolling stops setScrollTimeout(newTimeout) ``` ### Customization Below is a list
  of the main files you can customize to your liking: 1. `config.js` contains the
  site configuration (see above). 2. `src/components/layout.js` contains the site
  layout. This is where the header, footer, and up arrow are displayed. 3. `src/components/layout.css`
  contains the site layout CSS. This is where you can customize the styles and colors
  of the site. 4. `src/components/seo.js` contains the site SEO. You can easily customize
  the SEO by editing the `siteMetadata` tree. 5. `src/components/header.js` contains
  the site header and navigation menu. You can easily customize the menu items by
  editing the `menutabs` tree. 6. `src/components/footer.js` contains the site footer.
  You can easily customize the footer items by editing the `pagefoot` tree. 7. `src/images`
  directory contains the `icon.png` used for the site favicon and other places a small
  icon is needed. 8. `src/pages` directory contains the site pages. You can easily
  add, remove, or edit pages here. - Make sure you also update the `src/components/header.js`
  file to include your new pages in the navigation menu. 9. In the root directory,
  you can also edit the `gatsby-config.js` file to change the site metadata and other
  settings. 10. Also in the root directory, you will find another directory called
  `static`. This directory contains the `"

## Background Story

I wanted to create a **Business Website** that was easy to setup and use, while also being fully customizable, and I think I've done just that. This project is a culmination of my experience as a software developer and my passion for creating useful applications. 

## Getting Started

### Installation & Set Up

1. Install the Gatsby CLI

   ```sh
   npm install -g gatsby-cli
   ```

2. Run the development server

   ```sh
   gastby develop
   ```

3. View the website at `http://localhost:8000`

### Building and Running for Production

1. Generate a full static production build

   ```sh
   gatsby build
   ```

2. Preview the site as it will appear once deployed

   ```sh
    gatsby serve
    ```

3. View the website at `http://localhost:9000`
4. Commit to GitHub
5. Create a new site on Netlify
6. Connect your GitHub account
7. Select your repository
8. Click `Deploy Site`
9. View your website at `https://<your-site-name>.netlify.app`
10. Optionally, you can also setup a custom domain name for your website

### Configuration

You can easily configure this website to your liking by following the steps below, changing it from a full website to a preview landing page for your product or app:

1. Open the `src/components/config.js` file
2. Update the `config` object with your information

    ```js
    export const CONFIG = {
        showLandingPage: false, // Set to false to hide the landing page
        showHeader: true, // Set to false to hide the header
        showFooter: true, // Set to false to hide the footer
    };

    ```

3. If you decide to use the app landing page, open the `src/components/landing.js` file to edit it and use the `static/images/landing` directory to store your images.
4. Optionally, you can also adjust the amount of time the up arrow is displayed before fading out by adjusting the `newTimeout` value in the `src/components/layout.js` file.

```js
    // Set a new timeout
    const newTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
        setShowScroll(false)
    }, 7000) // Hide button 7 seconds after scrolling stops
    setScrollTimeout(newTimeout)
```

### Customization

Below is a list of the main files you can customize to your liking:

1. `config.js` contains the site configuration (see above).
2. `src/components/layout.js` contains the site layout. This is where the header, footer, and up arrow are displayed.
3. `src/components/layout.css` contains the site layout CSS. This is where you can customize the styles and colors of the site.
4. `src/components/seo.js` contains the site SEO. You can easily customize the SEO by editing the `siteMetadata` tree.
5. `src/components/header.js` contains the site header and navigation menu. You can easily customize the menu items by editing the `menutabs` tree.
6. `src/components/footer.js` contains the site footer. You can easily customize the footer items by editing the `pagefoot` tree.
7. `src/images` directory contains the `icon.png` used for the site favicon and other places a small icon is needed.
8. `src/pages` directory contains the site pages. You can easily add, remove, or edit pages here.
    - Make sure you also update the `src/components/header.js` file to include your new pages in the navigation menu.
9. In the root directory, you can also edit the `gatsby-config.js` file to change the site metadata and other settings.
10. Also in the root directory, you will find another directory called `static`. This directory contains the `fonts` and `images` folders. You can use the `fonts` folder to store your custom fonts and the `images` folder to store your custom images used throughout the site.
11. Be sure to update your `<a href="#">` link tags to actual endpoints, they're set to dead ends in the site demo. Also, remove the `onClick={e => e.preventDefault()` javascript from your hyperlink `<a>` tags, which prevents links from opening.

## Guidelines for Forking This Project

If you fork this project, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Rename the Products**: Please change any references to [Your Product Name] to a name of your choosing that does not include the projects referenced on this website.
- **Change Company Information**: If your fork includes references to [Your Company Name], please replace these with your own information or generic placeholders.
- **Change the Copyright Information**: Be sure to change the copyright reference in the `footer.js` file.
- **Change Designs and Logos**: Be sure to change the logos and designs that originally referenced Early Bird Labs.
- **Change Site Metadata**: Change the website meta data in the `siteMetadata` tree located in the `seo.js` file to fit your company or product.
- **Change Contact Information**: Change any contact email references to `@example.com` or hyperlinks to Early Bird Labs.
- **Utilize Search in your IDE**: Do a mass search for "Early Bird Labs" and its products to ensure you have removed any references.
- **Compare Your Website with the Original**: The site is actively being hosted at [https://bizwebsite.netlify.app](https://bizwebsite.netlify.app). After you deploy your website, check it against the original website to ensure nothing looks similar. Your site should be structured the same but be almost completely different content wise.

This project serves as a great template for a business and/or product page, but it is important to do the work in order to update it and remove the original references to the original company/product/author.

I did not design this site to be a boilerplate template but I did design it to be dynamic so people can fork it and easily use it for their own purposes - as long as you change the original content and nothing is missed before you deploy it to production.

These guidelines are in place to prevent confusion between the original project and derivative works. We appreciate your cooperation!
