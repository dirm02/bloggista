  Available Features - AI-Powered Testing: More resilient tests using natural language

  instrumentation tests (Espresso, UiAutomator) - Custom Agent Tools: Extend functionality
  by providing app-specific `TrailblazeTool`s to the agent - Detailed Reporting: Comprehensive

  for Maestro to leverage intuitive, platform-agnostic UI interactions. ## Documentation

## Current Vision

Trailblaze enables adoption of AI powered tests in regular Android on-device instrumentation tests.
This allows leveraging existing execution environments and reporting systems, providing a path to gradually adopt
AI-driven tests at scale.

Because Trailblaze uses [Maestro](https://github.com/mobile-dev-inc/maestro) Command Models for UI interactions it
enables a longer term vision of cross-platform ui testing while reusing the same authoring, agent
and reporting capabilities.

### Available Features

- AI-Powered Testing: More resilient tests using natural language test steps
- On-Device Execution: Runs directly on Android devices using standard instrumentation tests (Espresso, UiAutomator)
- Custom Agent Tools: Extend functionality by providing app-specific `TrailblazeTool`s to the agent
- Detailed Reporting: Comprehensive test execution reports
- Maestro Integration: Uses a custom build on-device driver for Maestro to leverage intuitive, platform-agnostic UI
  interactions.
