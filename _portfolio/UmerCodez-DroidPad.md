## **Reading Interactions**  
When users interact with the control pad, JSON-formatted or CSV messages are generated based on the type of component used. 
These string messages enable receivers to understand and process interactions sent from the control pad. Below are the formats and details for each interaction:  

---

### **SWITCH**  
Toggling a switch generates the following JSON:  
```json
{
  "id": "the id you specified",
  "type": "SWITCH",
  "state": true
}
```
For **Bluetooth** and **Bluetooth LE** connections, toggling a switch generates a `CSV` message in the format: `<id>,SWITCH,<state>`.

- The `state` field indicates whether the switch is **on** (`true`) or **off** (`false`).  

---

### **BUTTON**  
Pressing or releasing a button generates this JSON:  
```json
{
  "id": "the id you specified",
  "type": "BUTTON",
  "state": "PRESS"
}
```
For **Bluetooth** and **Bluetooth LE** connections, pressing or releasing a button generates a `CSV` message in the format: `<id>,BUTTON,<state>`.

- The `state` field can have following values:  
  - **"PRESS"**: When the button is being pressed (finger on the button).  
  - **"RELEASE"**: When the button is released (finger lifted off after pressing).
  - **"CLICK"**: Indicates tap gesture   

---

### **DPAD (Directional Pad)**  
Pressing or releasing a button on DPAD generates this JSON:  
```json
{
  "id": "the id you specified",
  "type": "DPAD",
  "button": "RIGHT",
  "state": "CLICK"
}
```
For **Bluetooth** and **Bluetooth LE** connections, pressing or releasing a button on DPAD generates a `CSV` message in the format: `<id>,DPAD,<button>,<state>`.

- The `state` field can have following values:  
  - **"PRESS"**: When the button is being pressed (finger on the button).  
  - **"RELEASE"**: When the button is released (finger lifted off after pressing).
  - **"CLICK"**: Indicates tap gesture
- The `button` field can be **"LEFT"**,**"RIGHT"**,**"UP"** or **"DOWN"**    

---
### **STEERING WHEEL**
Rotating a steering wheel generates this JSON:
```json
{
  "id": "your id",
  "type": "STEERING_WHEEL",
  "angle": 45.233445
}
```
For **Bluetooth** and **Bluetooth LE** connections the `CSV` is `<id>,STEERING_WHEEL,<angle>`

 - where `angle` is rotation angle of the steering wheel in degrees
   - **Positive values** indicate clockwise rotation
   - **Negative values** indicate counter-clockwise (anti-clockwise) rotation 

   

---

### **JOYSTICK**  
Moving joystick handle generates this JSON:  
```json
{
  "id": "the id you specified",
  "type": "JOYSTICK",
  "x": 0.71150637,
  "y": -0.13367589
}
```
For **Bluetooth** and **Bluetooth LE** : `<id>,JOYSTICK,<x>,<y>`

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd3b1b14-d1c5-42d5-8813-f01745856191" width="150" height="150">

_Note : Joystick is not rotatable in the Builder Screen_

The values of x and y range:
 - From -1.0 to 1.0 for both axes.
 - Positive x values indicate movement to the right, and negative values indicate movement to the left.
 - Positive y values indicate upward movement, and negative values indicate downward movement.    

### **SLIDER**  
Dragging the slider thumb generates the following JSON:  
```json
{
  "id": "the id you specified",
  "type": "SLIDER",
  "value": 1.4
}
```
For **Bluetooth** and **Bluetooth LE** connections, dragging the slider thumb generates a `CSV` message in the format: `<id>,SLIDER,<value>`.

- The `value` field represents the current position of the slider.  
- The value is always within the range of the minimum and maximum values specified during the slider's configuration.

### **LED**
To update the LED, send the following JSON message to the app:
```json
{
  "id": "the id you specified",
  "type": "LED",
  "state": "ON"
}
```
- `state` accepts the following values:

  - `"ON"` – Turns the LED on
  - `"OFF"` – Turns the LED off
  - `"BLINK"` – Makes the LED blink

## Sending JSON Messages to DroidPad

You can send JSON messages to DroidPad to update the UI. All connection types are supported except for **BLE**. You can update following component

- SWITCH
- SLIDER
- LED
- GAUGE

To update a **SWITCH**, **SLIDER**, **LED**, or **GAUGE** send a JSON object message similar to the ones specified in the [SWITCH](#switch), [SLIDER](#slider), [LED](#led), [GAUGE](#gauge) sections, with the desired value or state.

For **Bluetooth Classic** and **TCP** connections, you must send each JSON message on a new line. This is because DroidPad reads the incoming stream line by line. Each JSON message should be on a single line, and multiple messages should be separated by a line feed (`\n`).

For example:

```
{"id":"s1","type":"SLIDER","value":1.4}\n{"id":"s1","type":"SLIDER","value":1.5}\n{"id":"s1","type":"SLIDER","value":1.4}
```

For **MQTT**, **WebSocket**, and **UDP** connections, you can send formatted JSON without the one-line and line feed restrictions, as these are message-based protocols. For **MQTT** you have to publish to `DroidPad/feed` topic


## Important Note for Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy  
A long Bluetooth device name can cause advertisement failure (In case of BLE). To avoid this issue, use a shorter name. In your device's Bluetooth settings, change the Bluetooth device name to five or fewer characters, such as `dev`.

For devices running **Android 12 or higher**, you also need to ensure that your app has the necessary Bluetooth permissions. To do this, go to the app's system settings and grant the required **Nearby Devices** permission. Without this permission, the app won't be able to advertise Bluetooth LE services or access paired devices when using Bluetooth Classic.

## ⚠️ Limitations of Control Pad Sharing via QRCode and Json file
Although DroidPad allows you to share your control pads via QR code and JSON file, this feature has certain limitations. The app does not implement a grid system for item placement; instead, all items are positioned relative to the origin point at the top-left corner (0,0) of the control pad. As a result, when you import a control pad onto a device with a different screen size, DroidPad applies an offset shift to all items to adapt them to the new dimensions. In some cases, this automatic adjustment may require manual fine-tuning by the user importing it

## Testing the connection
You can test the connections with Websocket,TCP, UDP servers and BLE client provided in [https://github.com/UmerCodez/droidpad-python-examples](https://github.com/UmerCodez/droidpad-python-examples)
