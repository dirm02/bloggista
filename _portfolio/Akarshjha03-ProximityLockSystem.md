  Automatically locks your desktop when your phone moves out of Bluetooth range. ---
  ## ⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNING **Please test this CLI application on virtual machines first
  before using it on your actual system.** As we are constantly improving this app
  and reducing issues, we strongly recommend testing it in a safe environment (like
  a virtual machine) to ensure it works as expected with your specific setup. Only
  proceed to use it on your actual system once you feel confident and safe with its
  behavior. ## Requirements - Python 3.8 or newer - A working Bluetooth adapter on
  the host machine - Platform-specific lock utilities (usually present by default)
  - Windows: built-in LockWorkStation - macOS: CGSession or other locking utilities
  - Linux: GNOME `gnome-screensaver` or other lock commands ## Installation ### Prerequisites
  - Python 3.8 or newer ### Install the application ```bash pip install pybluez pip
  install proximity-lock-system ``` Note: On Windows, requirements.txt references
  pybluez and a Windows-friendly pybluez-win10 option. If you have trouble installing
  the library from PyPI, consider installing from the project's GitHub or using the
  pybluez-win10 wheel. ### Setup and start the service ```bash proximity-lock setup
  proximity-lock start ``` ### Stop the service Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the monitoring
  service. ## Usage ### Running the application ```bash proximity-lock ``` ### Example
  output The CLI will scan for nearby Bluetooth devices and prompt you to choose your
  phone: ``` \U0001F50D Scanning for nearby Bluetooth devices... Available devices:
  [0] Akarsh's iPhone (D8:B0:53:4F:8F:8F) Enter the number of your phone: 0 \U0001F4E1
  Monitoring device: D8:B0:53:4F:8F:8F ✅ Device in range. ✅ Device in range. ⚠️ Device
  not found (1/2) ⚠️ Device not found (2/2) \U0001F512 System locked due to phone
  out of range. ⏸️ Pausing checks for 3 minutes after lock... ``` Once selected, it
  will monitor the device and lock the system when the phone has been out of range
  for the configured threshold. ## Platform notes - Windows: The tool uses `rundll32.exe
  user32.dll,LockWorkStation` to lock the session. No extra packages are required.
  - macOS: Uses `CGSession -suspend`. If that doesn't work on newer macOS versions,
  consider running an AppleScript or `osascript` command to lock the screen. - Linux:
  Calls `gnome-screensaver-command -l` (GNOME). If you use another DE, replace the
  command with one that works for your environment (for example `loginctl lock-session`,
  `dm-tool lock`, or other `xdg` alternatives). ## System Performance ### Lock Trigger
  Latency The graph shows how quickly the system locks the device as the paired device
  moves away. ## Configuration Tweak the constants in `proximity_lock_system/config.py`:
  - `POLL_INTERVAL` — seconds between checks - `UNLOCK_PAUSE` — pause after manual
  unlock (seconds) - `SAFETY_THRESHOLD` — consecutive misses before locking - `SCAN_DURATION`
  — seconds per Bluetooth scan ## Troubleshooting - No devices found: ensure your
  phone's Bluetooth is turned on and discoverable. - Permission/adapter errors: ensure
  the OS user has permission to access Bluetooth and that the adapter is enabled.
  - Lock not working on Linux/macOS: the project uses a DE-specific command; update
  `proximity_lock_system/core.py` to call a command available on your system. ## Star

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNING

**Please test this CLI application on virtual machines first before using it on your actual system.**

As we are constantly improving this app and reducing issues, we strongly recommend testing it in a safe environment (like a virtual machine) to ensure it works as expected with your specific setup. Only proceed to use it on your actual system once you feel confident and safe with its behavior.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or newer
- A working Bluetooth adapter on the host machine
- Platform-specific lock utilities (usually present by default)
  - Windows: built-in LockWorkStation
  - macOS: CGSession or other locking utilities
  - Linux: GNOME `gnome-screensaver` or other lock commands

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or newer

### Install the application

```bash
pip install pybluez
pip install proximity-lock-system
```

Note: On Windows, requirements.txt references pybluez and a 
Windows-friendly pybluez-win10 option. If you have trouble installing 
the library from PyPI, consider installing from the project's GitHub or 
using the pybluez-win10 wheel.

### Setup and start the service

```bash
proximity-lock setup
proximity-lock start
```

### Stop the service
Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the monitoring service.

## Usage

### Running the application

```bash
proximity-lock
```

### Example output
The CLI will scan for nearby Bluetooth devices and prompt you to choose your phone:

```
🔍 Scanning for nearby Bluetooth devices...
Available devices:
[0] Akarsh's iPhone (D8:B0:53:4F:8F:8F)
Enter the number of your phone: 0

📡 Monitoring device: D8:B0:53:4F:8F:8F
✅ Device in range.
✅ Device in range.
⚠️ Device not found (1/2)
⚠️ Device not found (2/2)
🔒 System locked due to phone out of range.
⏸️ Pausing checks for 3 minutes after lock...
```

Once selected, it will monitor the device and lock the system when the phone has been out of range for the configured threshold.

## Platform notes
- Windows: The tool uses `rundll32.exe user32.dll,LockWorkStation` to lock the session. No extra packages are required.
- macOS: Uses `CGSession -suspend`. If that doesn't work on newer macOS versions, consider running an AppleScript or `osascript` command to lock the screen.
- Linux: Calls `gnome-screensaver-command -l` (GNOME). If you use another DE, replace the command with one that works for your environment (for example `loginctl lock-session`, `dm-tool lock`, or other `xdg` alternatives).

## System Performance

### Lock Trigger Latency
![Latency Graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dirm02/mystars/master/starred-readmes/Akarshjha03-ProximityLockSystem/latency.png)

The graph shows how quickly the system locks the device as the paired device moves away.


## Configuration
Tweak the constants in `proximity_lock_system/config.py`:
- `POLL_INTERVAL` — seconds between checks
- `UNLOCK_PAUSE` — pause after manual unlock (seconds)
- `SAFETY_THRESHOLD` — consecutive misses before locking
- `SCAN_DURATION` — seconds per Bluetooth scan

## Troubleshooting
- No devices found: ensure your phone's Bluetooth is turned on and discoverable.
- Permission/adapter errors: ensure the OS user has permission to access Bluetooth and that the adapter is enabled.
- Lock not working on Linux/macOS: the project uses a DE-specific command; update `proximity_lock_system/core.py` to call a command available on your system.
