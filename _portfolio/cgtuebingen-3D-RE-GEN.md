  --> # About We propose single-image 3D scene reconstruction for producing complete,
  editable scenes from a single photograph. Our method reconstructs individual objects
  and the surrounding background as textured 3D assets, enabling coherent scene assembly
  from minimal input. We combine instance segmentation, context-aware generative inpainting,
  2D-to-3D asset creation, and constrained optimization to recover physically plausible
  geometry, materials, and lighting. The resulting scenes preserve correct spatial
  relationships, lighting consistency, and material fidelity, making them suitable
  for production-ready workflows. # Getting Started See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md)
  for setup instructions. Quick start: ```bash git clone --recursive https://github.com/cgtuebingen/3D-RE-GEN.git
