  of [Wasp](https://wasp.sh/) on macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL, run the following
  command: ```bash npm i -g @wasp.sh/wasp-cli ``` Then, create a new SaaS app with
  the following command: ```bash wasp new -t saas ``` This will create a **clean copy
  of the Open SaaS template** into a new directory, and you can start building your
  SaaS app right away! ### Detailed Instructions For everything you need to know about
  getting started and using this template, check out the [Open SaaS Docs](https://docs.opensaas.sh).
  We've documented everything in great detail, including installation instructions,
  pulling updates to the template, guides for integrating services, SEO, deployment,
  and more. \U0001F680 ## Getting Help & Providing Feedback There are two ways to

  ## Contributing Note that we've tried to get as many of the core features of a SaaS
  app into this template as possible, but there still might be some missing features
  or functionality. We could always use some help tying up loose ends: contributions
