  a local DNS resolver that helps you eliminate distractions and get deep work done.
  It blocks all domains by default — only the ones you explicitly allow can get through.
  This means notifications, social media, news, and other time-sinks are unreachable
  at the network level — not just in your browser. It features a modern HTTP API,
  wildcard pattern support, and a beautiful terminal UI for real-time monitoring and

  serious about focus. ## Motivation Most tools make you list what you want to block.
  But the internet is infinite — that list never ends. It's much easier to list the
  few things you actually want to allow. Sinkzone was born from that insight. I was
  tired of coding sessions interrupted by Slack pings and email alerts. I needed something
  stronger than a browser plugin — a system-level kill switch for distractions. Now
  I can code for hours uninterrupted. Even my son uses Sinkzone during chess practice
  to stay focused. **Sinkzone exists because I needed it. Maybe you do too.** ---
  ## Why use Sinkzone? - Avoid distraction without browser extensions or hacks - Run
  locally on macOS, Linux and Windows — no cloud, no telemetry - Perfect for deep
  work sessions, writing, coding, or child safety - Terminal UI included — toggle
  modes, view logs, edit allowlist --- ## Key Features - **DNS-level blocking**: Stops
  distractions before they reach your apps - **Focus Mode**: Block all but allowlisted
  domains for a set duration - **Wildcard Support**: Use patterns like `*github*`
  or `*.google.com` for flexible domain matching - **HTTP API**: RESTful API for monitoring
  and control - **Terminal UI**: Real-time DNS traffic viewer with tabbed interface

## What is Sinkzone?

Sinkzone is a local DNS resolver that helps you eliminate distractions and get deep work done. It blocks all domains by default — only the ones you explicitly allow can get through. This means notifications, social media, news, and other time-sinks are unreachable at the network level — not just in your browser.

It features a modern HTTP API, wildcard pattern support, and a beautiful terminal UI for real-time monitoring and control.

It's lightweight, cross-platform, and built for hackers, makers, and anyone serious about focus.

## Motivation

Most tools make you list what you want to block. But the internet is infinite — that list never ends. It's much easier to list the few things you actually want to allow.

Sinkzone was born from that insight. I was tired of coding sessions interrupted by Slack pings and email alerts. I needed something stronger than a browser plugin — a system-level kill switch for distractions.

Now I can code for hours uninterrupted. Even my son uses Sinkzone during chess practice to stay focused.

## Usage

### Common Commands

| Command                  | Description                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `sinkzone monitor`       | Show last 20 DNS requests      |
| `sinkzone tui`           | Launch the terminal UI         |
| `sinkzone resolver`      | Start DNS resolver on port 53  |
| `sinkzone focus start`   | Enable focus mode for 1 hour   |
| `sinkzone focus --disable` | Disable focus mode immediately |
| `sinkzone status`        | View current focus mode state  |
| `sinkzone allowlist add <domain>` | Add domain to allowlist |
| `sinkzone allowlist add "*github*"` | Add wildcard pattern |
| `sinkzone allowlist remove <domain>` | Remove domain from allowlist |
| `sinkzone allowlist list` | List all allowed domains |
| `sinkzone config set resolver <ip>` | Set resolver IP |
| `sinkzone man` | Show manual page |

**Note:** On Unix-like systems (macOS/Linux), you may need to run `sudo sinkzone resolver` for port 53. On Windows, run as Administrator or use an unprivileged port like 5353.

### Wildcard Patterns

Sinkzone supports wildcard patterns for flexible domain matching:

| Pattern | Matches | Examples |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `*github*` | Any domain containing "github" | `github.com`, `api.github.com`, `githubusercontent.com` |
| `*.google.com` | All subdomains of google.com | `maps.google.com`, `drive.google.com`, `docs.google.com` |
| `api.*.com` | Any api subdomain of .com domains | `api.github.com`, `api.example.com`, `api.stackoverflow.com` |
| `exact.com` | Exact domain match only | `exact.com` (not `sub.exact.com`) |

**Examples:**
```bash
# Allow all GitHub-related domains
sinkzone allowlist add "*github*"

# Allow all Google subdomains
sinkzone allowlist add "*.google.com"

# Allow all API subdomains
sinkzone allowlist add "api.*.com"

# Allow exact domain
sinkzone allowlist add "stackoverflow.com"
```

### TUI Navigation

* `←`/`→`: Switch tabs
* `f`: Enable focus mode (1 hour)
* `ESC`: Quit
* Tabs include:

  * **Monitor**: Real-time DNS traffic
  * **Allowlist**: Add or remove allowed domains
  * **Settings**: DNS resolver config


## How It Works

### Architecture

Sinkzone is composed of three parts:

* **Resolver**: A local DNS server that intercepts queries and maintains real-time data via HTTP API.
* **HTTP API Server**: Provides REST endpoints for monitoring DNS queries and controlling focus mode.
* **TUI/CLI**: User interfaces that communicate with the resolver via HTTP API.
* **TUI**: A terminal UI for interacting with and monitoring the system via HTTP API.

### API Endpoints

The resolver exposes the following HTTP endpoints:

- `GET /api/queries` - Get the last 100 DNS queries
- `GET /api/focus` - Get current focus mode state
- `POST /api/focus` - Set focus mode (enabled/disabled, duration)
- `GET /api/state` - Get complete resolver state
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

**API Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Start resolver with custom API port
sinkzone resolver --port 53 --api-port 8080

# Use CLI with custom API URL
sinkzone monitor --api-url http://127.0.0.1:8080
sinkzone focus --enable --api-url http://127.0.0.1:8080
sinkzone tui --api-url http://127.0.0.1:8080

# Direct API calls
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/queries
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/focus
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/focus \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"enabled": true, "duration": "1h"}'
```

### Normal Mode

* All DNS queries are forwarded to upstream resolvers
* You can view and manage DNS traffic and allowlist

### Focus Mode

* Only allowlisted domains resolve
* Everything else returns `NXDOMAIN`
* Automatically expires after specified duration
* Allowlist is reloaded when focus mode is enabled (changes take effect on new focus sessions)

---

## Configuration

Files are stored in `~/.sinkzone/`:

* `sinkzone.yaml`: Main config
* `allowlist.txt`: Simple text file containing allowed domains (supports wildcard patterns)
* `resolver.pid`: Process ID file for the DNS resolver

**Allowlist Format:**
```
# Comments start with #
github.com
stackoverflow.com
*github*
*.google.com
api.*.com
```

---

## Development

```bash
# Build binary
go build -o sinkzone .

# Run tests
go test ./...

# Run resolver with custom ports
sinkzone resolver --port 5353 --api-port 8080

# Test API endpoints
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/queries

# Run TUI with custom API URL
sinkzone tui --api-url http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

**Architecture:**
- DNS Server: Handles DNS resolution and blocking
- HTTP API Server: Provides REST endpoints for monitoring and control
- CLI/TUI: User interfaces that communicate via HTTP API
