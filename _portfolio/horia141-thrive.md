# The Thrive Goal Management System ![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/horia141/thrive) ![Develop](https://github.com/horia141/thrive/workflows/Develop/badge.svg) [![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

Thrive is a tool for _life planning_. It provides goals management, task tracking,
habit building, chores management, lists, metrics, a personal relationship manager,
and much more all in a unified package.

I built it to [solve an issue I had](http://www.paulgraham.com/organic.html) - making
sure everything I wanted to get done actually got done, while juggling the
standard complexities of life - family, kids, career, etc.

The current version is both a [webapp](https://get-thriving.com) and a CLI application.
