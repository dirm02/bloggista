  board. Users select which pins are active (LEDs ON), and the software infers the

  tool, not a USB-IF compliance certifier. ## Features - **Real-time Analysis**: Live
  diagnostic updates as you interact with checkboxes. - **Comprehensive Cable Support**:
  Analyzes USB 2.0, SuperSpeed (USB 3.x), CC lines, SBU lines, and power delivery.
  - **Broken Pair Detection**: Explicitly identifies incomplete differential pairs
  (e.g., TX1+ without TX1-) and reports them as potential cable damage. - **Lane-Level
  Reporting**: Independent status for each SuperSpeed lane (Lane 1 & Lane 2) with
  specific pin counts. - **Detailed Diagnostics**: - Complete lane status (OK / INCOMPLETE
  / MISSING) - Broken differential pair identification - Orientation-dependent operation
  warnings - **Auto-Classification**: Smart cable type identification with specific
  labels (charge-only, USB 2.0, USB 3.x, Alt-Mode capable, non-compliant). - **Convenient
  Controls**: Select All / Unselect All buttons and Copy to Clipboard functionality.
  - **User-Friendly UI**: Tooltips on all pin checkboxes explaining each pin''s function.
  ## Installation 1. Clone the repository: ``` git clone https://github.com/aroslanov/USB_Cable_Capability_Analyzer
  cd USB_Cable_Capability_Analyzer ``` 2. Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed (Tkinter
  is included in standard Python installations). 3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
  ``` python -m venv .venv .venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows ``` 4. Run the application:
  - **Directly with Python:** ``` python usb_cable_tool.py ``` - **On Linux/macOS:**
  ``` chmod +x run.sh # Run this only once to make the script executable ./run.sh
  ``` - **On Windows (Batch):** ``` run.bat ``` - **On Windows (PowerShell):** ```
  .\run.ps1 ``` ## Usage - Launch the GUI. - Check the boxes corresponding to the
  pins that are active (LEDs ON) on your USB Cable Tester board. - The analysis updates
  in real-time below the checkboxes. - Use "Select All" to check all pins, "Unselect
  All" to clear them. - Click "Copy to Clipboard" to copy the full report. - Hover
  over checkboxes for tooltips explaining each pin. ## Analysis Details ### Broken
  Pair Detection The tool detects incomplete differential pairs (both TX and RX pairs)
  for each SuperSpeed lane. If a differential pair is broken (one wire present, the
  other missing), it will report "BROKEN PAIRS DETECTED" with specific identification
  of which pairs are broken. **Example**: If TX1+ is present but TX1- is missing,
  the tool reports "Lane 1 TX pair broken" and classifies the cable as non-compliant.
  ### Lane-Level Reporting Each SuperSpeed lane is analyzed independently: - **OK**:
  All 4 pins present (TX+, TX-, RX+, RX-) - **INCOMPLETE**: Partial pins detected
  with count (e.g., 3/4 pins) - **MISSING**: No pins from that lane detected ### Auto-Classification
  The tool automatically classifies cables into categories: - Charge-only USB-C cable
  - USB 2.0 data cable - USB-C 3.x cable (with or without Alt-Mode support) - Non-standard
  / damaged SuperSpeed cable - Non-compliant cable (when broken pairs detected) Orientation
  warnings are provided for single-lane operation (flip-dependent). ## Requirements

A GUI tool to analyze USB-C cable wiring and capabilities based on pin connections.

## Description

This tool mimics the Treedix C-TRX5-0575 / Occkic MRB063A / Noname USB Cable Tester USB Cable Tester board. Users select which pins are active (LEDs ON), and the software infers the cable's wiring, capabilities, and auto-classifies it.

**Note:** This is a diagnostic tool, not a USB-IF compliance certifier.

## Features

- **Real-time Analysis**: Live diagnostic updates as you interact with checkboxes.
- **Comprehensive Cable Support**: Analyzes USB 2.0, SuperSpeed (USB 3.x), CC lines, SBU lines, and power delivery.
- **Broken Pair Detection**: Explicitly identifies incomplete differential pairs (e.g., TX1+ without TX1-) and reports them as potential cable damage.
- **Lane-Level Reporting**: Independent status for each SuperSpeed lane (Lane 1 & Lane 2) with specific pin counts.
- **Detailed Diagnostics**:
  - Complete lane status (OK / INCOMPLETE / MISSING)
  - Broken differential pair identification
  - Orientation-dependent operation warnings
- **Auto-Classification**: Smart cable type identification with specific labels (charge-only, USB 2.0, USB 3.x, Alt-Mode capable, non-compliant).
- **Convenient Controls**: Select All / Unselect All buttons and Copy to Clipboard functionality.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Tooltips on all pin checkboxes explaining each pin's function.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aroslanov/USB_Cable_Capability_Analyzer
   cd USB_Cable_Capability_Analyzer
   ```

2. Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed (Tkinter is included in standard Python installations).

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

4. Run the application:

   - **Directly with Python:**
     ```
     python usb_cable_tool.py
     ```

   - **On Linux/macOS:**
     ```
     chmod +x run.sh  # Run this only once to make the script executable
     ./run.sh
     ```

   - **On Windows (Batch):**
     ```
     run.bat
     ```

   - **On Windows (PowerShell):**
     ```
     .\run.ps1
     ```

## Usage

- Launch the GUI.
- Check the boxes corresponding to the pins that are active (LEDs ON) on your  USB Cable Tester board.
- The analysis updates in real-time below the checkboxes.
- Use "Select All" to check all pins, "Unselect All" to clear them.
- Click "Copy to Clipboard" to copy the full report.
- Hover over checkboxes for tooltips explaining each pin.

## Analysis Details

### Broken Pair Detection
The tool detects incomplete differential pairs (both TX and RX pairs) for each SuperSpeed lane. If a differential pair is broken (one wire present, the other missing), it will report "BROKEN PAIRS DETECTED" with specific identification of which pairs are broken.

**Example**: If TX1+ is present but TX1- is missing, the tool reports "Lane 1 TX pair broken" and classifies the cable as non-compliant.

### Lane-Level Reporting
Each SuperSpeed lane is analyzed independently:
- **OK**: All 4 pins present (TX+, TX-, RX+, RX-)
- **INCOMPLETE**: Partial pins detected with count (e.g., 3/4 pins)
- **MISSING**: No pins from that lane detected

### Auto-Classification
The tool automatically classifies cables into categories:
- Charge-only USB-C cable
- USB 2.0 data cable
- USB-C 3.x cable (with or without Alt-Mode support)
- Non-standard / damaged SuperSpeed cable
- Non-compliant cable (when broken pairs detected)

Orientation warnings are provided for single-lane operation (flip-dependent).

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Tkinter (included with Python)
