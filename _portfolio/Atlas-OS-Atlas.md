  or Atlas, is an open-source project that enhances Windows by conveniently applying
  privacy, usability, and performance optimizations, all while maintaining functionality
  and [customizability](https://docs.atlasos.net/getting-started/post-installation/atlas-folder/general-configuration/).
  ## \U0001F440 Why Atlas? ### \U0001F512 Enhanced Privacy Atlas removes the majority
  of telemetry embedded within Windows and implements numerous group policies to minimize
  data collection. However, it cannot ensure privacy outside the scope of Windows,
  such as browsers and other third-party applications. ### \U0001F4C8 Optimized Performance
  Atlas strikes a balance between performance and compatibility. It implements numerous
  meaningful changes to improve Windows performance and responsiveness without breaking
  essential features. Atlas will not do tweaks for a placebo effect or marginal gains,
  making Atlas more stable and compatible. ### \U0001F6E1️ Security Features Most
  Windows modifications remove key security features most users need to maintain a
  secure system. On the other hand, Atlas allows users to customize their security
  at their own risk while informing users about each option's [pros and cons](https://docs.atlasos.net/getting-started/post-installation/atlas-folder/security/).
  Some optional security features are: - Windows Defender & SmartScreen - Windows
  Update - Automatic updates are toggleable - CPU mitigations - User Account Control
  - Core isolation features ### ✅ Increased Usability Atlas applies many modifications
  and default settings to make Windows easier to use. This includes removing commonly
  unneeded applications (which are reinstallable), configuring many aspects of the
  interface, disabling advertisements, and much more. ### \U0001F50D Open Source and
  Transparent Unlike custom Windows ISOs, Atlas is more straightforward to audit due
  to the use of [AME Wizard](https://amelabs.net). AME Wizard is controlled by Playbooks,
  a customizable script-esque system that can perform various tasks. Playbooks are
  renamed **.zip** archives, with the password [`malte`](https://docs.amelabs.net/developers/getting-started/creation.html).
  As they primarily consist of plain text, Playbooks enable transparency, unlike custom
  Windows ISOs, which have many entry points for malicious activity. The few binaries
  in the Playbook are open source in our [`utilities` repository](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/utilities),
  with the [hashes listed here](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/blob/main/src/playbook/Executables/AtlasModules/README.md).
  Although the GUI is not open source for AME Wizard, AME Wizard's entire backend
  (called [TrustedUninstaller](https://github.com/Ameliorated-LLC/trusted-uninstaller-cli))
  is open source under MIT, which contains each action used to run Atlas. The Atlas
  Playbook is open source under the [GPLv3 license](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/blob/main/LICENSE).
  ### \U0001F512 Legal Compliance As Atlas doesn't redistribute a modified Windows
  ISO, it complies with the [Microsoft Windows Usage Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/content/dam/microsoft/usetm/documents/windows/11/oem-(pre-installed)/UseTerms_OEM_Windows_11_English.pdf).
  In addition, Atlas does not alter activation in Windows. ## \U0001F3A8 Brand kit

## 🤔 What is Atlas?

AtlasOS, or Atlas, is an open-source project that enhances Windows by conveniently applying privacy, usability, and performance optimizations, all while maintaining functionality and [customizability](https://docs.atlasos.net/getting-started/post-installation/atlas-folder/general-configuration/).

## 👀 Why Atlas?
### 🔒 Enhanced Privacy
Atlas removes the majority of telemetry embedded within Windows and implements numerous group policies to minimize data collection. However, it cannot ensure privacy outside the scope of Windows, such as browsers and other third-party applications.

### 📈 Optimized Performance
Atlas strikes a balance between performance and compatibility. It implements numerous meaningful changes to improve Windows performance and responsiveness without breaking essential features. Atlas will not do tweaks for a placebo effect or marginal gains, making Atlas more stable and compatible.

### 🛡️ Security Features
Most Windows modifications remove key security features most users need to maintain a secure system. On the other hand, Atlas allows users to customize their security at their own risk while informing users about each option's [pros and cons](https://docs.atlasos.net/getting-started/post-installation/atlas-folder/security/).

Some optional security features are:

- Windows Defender & SmartScreen
- Windows Update
- Automatic updates are toggleable
- CPU mitigations
- User Account Control
- Core isolation features

### ✅ Increased Usability
Atlas applies many modifications and default settings to make Windows easier to use. This includes removing commonly unneeded applications (which are reinstallable), configuring many aspects of the interface, disabling advertisements, and much more.

### 🔍 Open Source and Transparent

Unlike custom Windows ISOs, Atlas is more straightforward to audit due to the use of [AME Wizard](https://amelabs.net). AME Wizard is controlled by Playbooks, a customizable script-esque system that can perform various tasks.

Playbooks are renamed **.zip** archives, with the password [`malte`](https://docs.amelabs.net/developers/getting-started/creation.html). As they primarily consist of plain text, Playbooks enable transparency, unlike custom Windows ISOs, which have many entry points for malicious activity. 

The few binaries in the Playbook are open source in our [`utilities` repository](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/utilities), with the [hashes listed here](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/blob/main/src/playbook/Executables/AtlasModules/README.md).

Although the GUI is not open source for AME Wizard, AME Wizard's entire backend (called [TrustedUninstaller](https://github.com/Ameliorated-LLC/trusted-uninstaller-cli)) is open source under MIT, which contains each action used to run Atlas. The Atlas Playbook is open source under the [GPLv3 license](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/blob/main/LICENSE).

### 🔒 Legal Compliance
As Atlas doesn't redistribute a modified Windows ISO, it complies with the [Microsoft Windows Usage Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/content/dam/microsoft/usetm/documents/windows/11/oem-(pre-installed)/UseTerms_OEM_Windows_11_English.pdf). In addition, Atlas does not alter activation in Windows.
