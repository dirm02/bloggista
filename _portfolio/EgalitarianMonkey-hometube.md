### 🍪 Cookies Authentication (Highly Recommended)

**Cookies authentication should be setup** for optimal video downloading experience and to avoid common download failures.

#### 🚨 **Why Cookies Are Essential**

Even for **public YouTube videos**, cookies are increasingly necessary because of modern protections.  
They ensure **higher quality, reliability, and access** to all formats:

- **🏆 Access the best quality** (AV1/Opus, high-res video, premium audio)  
- **🔓 Unlock restricted content** (age-gated, member-only, region-locked)  
- **🔐 Handle encrypted signatures (n-sig)** required for many video/audio streams  
- **🛡️ Bypass anti-bot measures** that block automated downloaders  
- **📺 Ensure stream availability** (audio/video may be signature-protected even for public videos)  
- **⚡ Improve reliability** (fewer "format unavailable" or extraction errors)  
- **🎵 Get high-quality audio tracks** (Opus, AAC) without failures  
- **🚀 Reduce throttling** for faster, more stable downloads  

👉 In short: **cookies are not just for private content — they’re the key to consistent, best-quality downloads.**

#### 🛠️ **Setup Options**

We can use **Browser cookies** if on a machine sharing a browser, otherwise **Cookies File** in HomeLab setup.

[More details about Cookies authentication setup](docs/usage.md#-authentication--private-content).

### ✂️ Advanced Video Processing

Transform your downloads with **powerful built-in video processing tools**:

- **🎬 Clip Extraction**: Cut specific segments from videos with precision timing
- **📝 Subtitle Embedding**: Automatically embed subtitles in multiple languages
- **🔄 Format Conversion**: Convert between video formats (MP4, MKV, WebM, etc.)
- **🎵 Audio Extraction**: Extract audio-only versions in high quality
- **📱 Mobile Optimization**: Optimize videos for mobile devices

[Explore all processing options](docs/usage.md#-video-processing).

### 🔧 Advanced configurations

Custom yt-dlp arguments support offers **full flexibility** for advanced users to tailor downloads to specific needs.

- **📱 Network configuration**: `--proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080 --retries 5`
- **📂 File size limits**: `--max-filesize 500M --min-filesize 100M`
- **📋 Enhanced metadata**: `--write-info-json --write-description --write-thumbnail`
- **🛜 Bandwidth control**: `--limit-rate 1M --fragment-retries 10`
- **➕ More options**: `yt-dlp --options variable`

Custom yt-dlp arguments can be added directly from the UI or set by default for any download with the `YTDLP_CUSTOM_ARGS` environment variable.

**🔀 Smart Conflict Resolution**: HomeTube automatically detects and resolves conflicts between base settings and custom arguments, giving priority to your custom preferences while maintaining system stability.

### 🎯 Smart Quality System

HomeTube uses **intelligent quality detection** that analyzes each video and automatically selects the **best available formats** with a **simple 2-profile strategy**:

**🔍 How It Works:**
- **📊 Real-time Analysis** → Detects all available video formats and codecs
- **🏆 Smart Ranking** → Prioritizes modern codecs (AV1 > VP9 > H.264) and audio quality (Opus > AAC)
- **🎯 Optimal Selection** → Generates up to 2 best profiles from actual available formats
- **🔄 Intelligent Fallback** → Tries best quality first, then second-best if needed

**Quality Profiles Generated:**
1. **🥇 Best Available** → Highest resolution with most modern codec (e.g., 4K AV1 + Opus)
2. **🥈 Fallback Option** → Next best combination (e.g., 4K VP9 + Opus)

**Download Strategies:**
- **🔄 Auto Best (Default)** → Tries up to 2 optimal profiles automatically until success
- **🏆 Best Only** → Only attempts highest quality, no fallback (stops if unavailable)
- **🎯 Choose Profile** → Manually select from detected optimal profiles
- **📋 Choose Format** → Advanced: select specific format IDs from all available formats

**🚀 Benefits:**
- ✅ Always gets the best quality actually available for each video
- ✅ No generic fallbacks - uses real format analysis
- ✅ Fast downloads with minimal retries (max 2 attempts)
- ✅ Supports all modern codecs: AV1, VP9, H.264, Opus, AAC

👉 [Full details on quality detection & strategies](docs/usage.md#-quality-profiles--download-modes)

### 🎯 Smart Download Management

**Intelligent download system** that adapts to your needs:

- **📁 Auto-Organization**: Videos organized by channel/creator automatically
- **⚡ Resume Support**: Interrupted downloads automatically resume
- **💾 Storage Optimization**: Duplicate detection and space management

[Learn more about download features](docs/usage.md#-basic-video-download).

### 📋 Intelligent Playlist Management

**Powerful playlist synchronization** with resilient tracking and perfect source fidelity:

**🔄 Smart Synchronization:**
- **📡 Source of Truth**: YouTube playlist is always the reference - local library stays perfectly synchronized
- **🔄 Auto-Refresh**: Playlist metadata automatically refreshed on each load for accurate status
- **📊 Instant Status**: See exactly which videos are downloaded, pending, or new at a glance
- **🎯 Incremental Downloads**: Only download new videos - existing ones are preserved and tracked

**📁 Resilient Video Tracking:**
- **🆔 ID-Based Tracking**: Videos tracked by unique ID - survives title changes on YouTube
- **📝 Pattern-Based Naming**: Flexible filename patterns with placeholders (`{idx}`, `{title}`, `{channel}`, etc.)
- **🔄 Smart Rename Detection**: Finds renamed files in destination folder automatically
- **📂 Index Preservation**: Maintains playlist order even when videos are reordered upstream

**🛡️ Robust Change Detection:**
- **➕ New Videos**: Automatically detected and queued for download
- **🔢 Reordering**: Detect and apply index changes with smart renaming
- **📂 Relocation**: Move entire playlist to new folder while preserving files
- **📦 Archive Mode**: Removed videos can be archived instead of deleted
- **🗑️ Clean Removal**: Optional deletion of videos removed from source playlist

**🎨 Customizable Title Patterns:**

```
{idx} - {pretty(title)}.{ext}           → 01 - My Video Title.mkv
{pretty(title)} - {channel}.{ext}       → My Video - Creator Name.mkv  
{i:03d} - {slug(title)} [{id}].{ext}    → 001 - my-video-title [abc123].mkv
```

**Supported placeholders:**
- `{idx}` - Smart zero-padded index (01, 02... or 001, 002... based on total)
- `{title}` / `{pretty(title)}` / `{slug(title)}` - Video title variants
- `{channel}` / `{pretty(channel)}` / `{slug(channel)}` - Channel name variants
- `{id}` - Video ID • `{ext}` - File extension

**📈 Progress Tracking:**
- Real-time download progress with visual indicators
- Detailed sync plan preview before applying changes
- Full logging of all operations for transparency

Set `PLAYLIST_KEEP_OLD_VIDEOS=true` (or enable *Keep videos removed from playlist* in the UI) to move removed entries into an `Archives/` folder instead of deleting them.

<!-- ![Application Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dirm02/mystars/master/starred-readmes/EgalitarianMonkey-hometube/docs/images/options_ui_demo.gif) -->
<!-- <br/><br/> -->

## 🚀 Quick Start

### ⚙️ Essential Configuration

**📋 HomeTube uses environment variables for all configurations**: videos download paths, temporary download folder, authentication, languages, quality profiles, and more.

Depending of the setup, Docker, Docker compose, Portainer, local run, environment variables can be passed to the application in different ways.

**`.env` file from `.env.sample` can be practical for rapid setup:**

```bash
# 1. Clone repository (if not already done)
git clone https://github.com/EgalitarianMonkey/hometube.git
cd hometube

# 2. Create your own configuration file from the sample
cp .env.sample .env
```

### 🐳 Docker

With Docker, environment variables can be passed either with `-e VARIABLE=` arguments or `--env-file .env`.

**`-e VARIABLE=`**

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 \
  -e TZ=America/New_York \
  -e VIDEOS_FOLDER=/data/videos \
  -e TMP_DOWNLOAD_FOLDER=/data/tmp \
  -e YOUTUBE_COOKIES_FILE_PATH=/config/youtube_cookies.txt \
  -v <VIDEOS_FOLDER_DOCKER_HOST>:/data/videos \
  -v <TMP_DOWNLOAD_FOLDER_DOCKER_HOST>:/data/tmp \
  -v <YOUTUBE_COOKIES_FILE_PATH_DOCKER_HOST>:/config \
  ghcr.io/egalitarianmonkey/hometube:latest
```

**`--env-file .env`**

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 \
  --env-file .env \
  -v <VIDEOS_FOLDER_DOCKER_HOST>:/data/videos \
  -v <TMP_DOWNLOAD_FOLDER_DOCKER_HOST>:/data/tmp \
  -v <YOUTUBE_COOKIES_FILE_PATH_DOCKER_HOST>:/config \
  ghcr.io/egalitarianmonkey/hometube:latest
```

**Access at <http://localhost:8501>**

### 🐳 Docker Compose

With Docker compose, environment variables can be passed either with the `environment:` entry or from the convenient `.env` file with `env_file: .env`.

#### Configuration with `.env` file

**`.env`**

```bash
# --- PORT ---
PORT=8510

# --- Timezone ---
TZ=America/New_York

# --- Languages ---
UI_LANGUAGE=en
LANGUAGE_PRIMARY=en
LANGUAGE_PRIMARY_INCLUDE_SUBTITLES=true
LANGUAGES_SECONDARIES=  # Optional: comma-separated (e.g., fr,es)

# --- Docker host paths ---
# Docker environment variables to specify depending on your homelab setup.
VIDEOS_FOLDER_DOCKER_HOST=/mnt/data/videos
TMP_DOWNLOAD_FOLDER_DOCKER_HOST=/mnt/data/hometube/tmp
YOUTUBE_COOKIES_FILE_PATH_DOCKER_HOST=/opt/cookies/youtube.txt

# --- Paths ---
# Internal Docker container paths (do not change)
VIDEOS_FOLDER=/data/videos
TMP_DOWNLOAD_FOLDER=/data/tmp
YOUTUBE_COOKIES_FILE_PATH=/config/youtube_cookies.txt
#COOKIES_FROM_BROWSER=brave # Not working natively in Docker
```

**docker-compose.yml**

```yaml
services:
  hometube:
    image: ghcr.io/egalitarianmonkey/hometube:latest
    env_file: .env
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ${VIDEOS_FOLDER_DOCKER_HOST:?set VIDEOS_FOLDER_DOCKER_HOST}
        target: /data/videos
      - type: bind
        source: ${TMP_DOWNLOAD_FOLDER_DOCKER_HOST:?set TMP_DOWNLOAD_FOLDER_DOCKER_HOST}
        target: /data/tmp
      - "${YOUTUBE_COOKIES_FILE_PATH_DOCKER_HOST}:/config/youtube_cookies.txt"
```

This **long volume structure** with `type:`, `source:`, and `target:` entries forces the environment variables to be set, otherwise the Docker deployment fails. This avoids silent failures and confusions when environment variables are missing.

#### Configuration with `environment:`:

**docker-compose.yml**

```yaml
services:
  hometube:
    image: ghcr.io/egalitarianmonkey/hometube:latest
    environment:
      UI_LANGUAGE: en
      LANGUAGE_PRIMARY: en
      LANGUAGE_PRIMARY_INCLUDE_SUBTITLES: true
      LANGUAGES_SECONDARIES: ""  # Optional: comma-separated
      VIDEOS_FOLDER: /data/videos
      TMP_DOWNLOAD_FOLDER: /data/tmp
      YOUTUBE_COOKIES_FILE_PATH: /config/youtube_cookies.txt
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ${VIDEOS_FOLDER_DOCKER_HOST:?set VIDEOS_FOLDER_DOCKER_HOST}
        target: /data/videos
      - type: bind
        source: ${TMP_DOWNLOAD_FOLDER_DOCKER_HOST:?set TMP_DOWNLOAD_FOLDER_DOCKER_HOST}
        target: /data/tmp
      - "${YOUTUBE_COOKIES_FILE_PATH_DOCKER_HOST}:/config/youtube_cookies.txt"
```

This **long volume structure** with `type:`, `source:`, and `target:` entries forces the environment variables to be set, otherwise the Docker deployment fails. This avoids silent failures and confusions when environment variables are missing.

**Access at <http://localhost:8501>**

### 🐳 Portainer

With Portainer, environment variables must be explicitly written in the `environment:` section of the container setup to get those environment variables in the app.

#### Portainer environment variables management

- It does not support `env_file:` entry for passing environment variables **in the container** from a `.env` file involving that the environment variables must be explicitly written in the `environment:` section of the container setup to get those environment variables in the app.
- It does not retrieve any Docker environment variables from a `.env` file as the stack isn't linked to any location. Environment variables for the Portainer docker-compose.yml stack must be **manually** entered from the UI either one by one or with a convenient `.env` upload.

**docker-compose.yml**

```yaml
services:
  hometube:
    image: ghcr.io/egalitarianmonkey/hometube:latest
    ports:
      - "${PORT:-8501}:8501"
    environment:
      TZ: "${TZ}"
      UI_LANGUAGE: en
      LANGUAGE_PRIMARY: en
      LANGUAGE_PRIMARY_INCLUDE_SUBTITLES: true
      LANGUAGES_SECONDARIES: ""  # Optional: comma-separated
      VIDEOS_FOLDER: /data/videos
      TMP_DOWNLOAD_FOLDER: /data/tmp
      YOUTUBE_COOKIES_FILE_PATH: "${YOUTUBE_COOKIES_FILE_PATH}"
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ${VIDEOS_FOLDER_DOCKER_HOST:?set VIDEOS_FOLDER_DOCKER_HOST}
        target: /data/videos
      - type: bind
        source: ${TMP_DOWNLOAD_FOLDER_DOCKER_HOST:?set TMP_DOWNLOAD_FOLDER_DOCKER_HOST}
        target: /data/tmp
      - "${YOUTUBE_COOKIES_FILE_PATH_DOCKER_HOST}:/config/youtube_cookies.txt"
```

This **long volume structure** with `type:`, `source:`, and `target:` entries forces the environment variables to be set, otherwise the Docker deployment fails. This avoids silent failures and confusions when environment variables are missing.

**Portainer environment variables in the UI**

```bash
VIDEOS_FOLDER_DOCKER_HOST=/mnt/data/videos
TMP_DOWNLOAD_FOLDER_DOCKER_HOST=/mnt/data/hometube/tmp
YOUTUBE_COOKIES_FILE_PATH_DOCKER_HOST=/opt/cookies/youtube.txt
TZ=America/New_York
PORT=8501
YOUTUBE_COOKIES_FILE_PATH=/config/youtube_cookies.txt
#COOKIES_FROM_BROWSER=chrome
```

### 🏠 Local Installation

**Environment variables for local run are setup following a specific order:**

- First, defined and **exported** environment variables from the current shell will be taken (`export VIDEOS_DIR=/data/videos`, `set -a && source .env && set +a`, etc.)
- Then, if a `.env` file exists, not defined environment variables from exported shell will be taken from local `.env` file
- At last, default values will be used for not defined environment variables from **shell** and `.env` file

**Prerequisites** are installed through python environment setup. Below are setups for `venv`, `conda`, or `uv`.

**Option 1: Using pip (Recommended)**

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv hometube-env
source hometube-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: hometube-env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies including yt-dlp
pip install ".[local]"

# Run the application
streamlit run app/main.py
# OR
python run.py
```

**Option 2: Using conda**

```bash
# Create conda environment
conda create -n hometube python=3.10
conda activate hometube

# Install dependencies including yt-dlp
pip install ".[local]"

# Run the application
streamlit run app/main.py
```

**Option 3: Using uv (Fastest)**

```bash
# Install uv if not already installed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies including yt-dlp
uv pip install ".[local]"

# Run with uv
uv run streamlit run app/main.py
```
