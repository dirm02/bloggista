  --- ## Quick Start \U0001F680 ```bash # runs with SQLite (default) docker run -p
  3000:3000 bagofwords/bagofwords ``` ### Or, run with a ready PostgreSQL instance
  ```bash docker run -p 3000:3000 \\ -e BOW_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname
  \\ bagofwords/bagofwords ``` #### Other deployment options docker compose and Kubernete
  deployments are also available (and recommended for servers). See the [docs](https://docs.bagofwords.com/install).
  ## Product Overview ### Chat with any data Create reports, deep analysis or quick
  visuals with an AI interface powered by an agentic-loop with tools, reasoning and
  reflection built in. ### Instructions Registry Manage AI rules and instructions
  with review process, full versioning and tracking. Sync with git to auto-index dbt,
  Tableau, AGENTS.md and more. ### Save data and queries to the Catalog Leverage the
  catalog to store, share, and explore reusable queries and datasets. This feature
  also improves discoverability and searchability for AI, contributing to smarter
  AI decisions. ### Monitor AI and data operations Full observability into queries,
  feedback, and context — powering self-learning and high quality AI results ## Architecture
  Bag of words acts as a **context-aware analytics layer** that connects to any database
  or service, works with any LLM, and enriches queries with docs, BI models, or code.
  The architecture is fully flexible: plug in any data source, any model, and any
  interface — giving your team maximum freedom of choice, without sacrificing governance
  or reliability. ## Integrations ### Supported LLM Integrations Bag of words supports
  a wide range of LLM providers out of the box. You can bring your own API key for
  any of the following: | Provider | Supported Models / APIs | Notes | |------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | **OpenAI** | GPT models, o-models, etc. | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (including
  self-hosted, vLLM, etc.) | | **Azure OpenAI** | GPT models, o-models, etc. | Azure
  resource/endpoint support, including model deployment names | | **Google Gemini**|
  Gemini, Flash versions, etc. | Requires Google Cloud API key | | **Anthropic** |
  Claude, Sonnet, Haiku | Just provide the API key | | **Any OpenAI-compatible** |
  vLLM, LM Studio, Ollama, etc. | Just provide the base URL and API key | > **Tip:**
  You can configure multiple providers and models, set defaults, and more. ### Data

## Enterprise

For teams requiring advanced security, compliance, and governance:

- **SSO:** Google Workspace and OIDC-compatible identity providers
- **Self-hosted:** Deploy on your own infrastructure with full data control
- **RBAC:** Role-based access control for fine-grained permissions

## 🔒 Security & Privacy
We take data security and privacy seriously.  

### Telemetry
By default, Bag of words captures basic usage stats of self-hosted instances to a centralized server. The data helps us improve the product.

You can disable by setting in `bow-config.yaml`

```yaml
telemetry
  enabled: false
```

You can also disable the Intercom chat for support

```yaml
intercom
  enabled: false
```
