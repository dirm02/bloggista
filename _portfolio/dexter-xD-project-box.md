  ### 2. [HTTP Server](http-server/) A basic HTTP server implementation that covers:
  - Socket programming - HTTP protocol basics - File serving - Network communication
  ### 3. [UDP Server-Client](udp-server-client/) A simple UDP-based communication
  system that teaches: - UDP socket programming - Client-server architecture - Network
  protocols - Message exchange ### 4. [Port Scanner](port-scanner/) A network diagnostic
  tool that demonstrates: - TCP socket programming - Network scanning techniques -
  Error handling - Command-line argument parsing ### 5. [Ping Implementation](ping/)

  detection ## Getting Started Each project in this repository is designed to be self-contained
  and includes: - Source code - Makefile or CMake configuration - README with build
  and usage instructions - Implementation details To get started with any project:
  1. Navigate to the project directory 2. Read the project's README.md 3. Follow the
  build instructions 4. Run the program as described ## Prerequisites - GCC compiler
  (for C projects) - G++ compiler (for C++ projects) - Make utility - CMake (for C/C++
  projects) - Basic understanding of C/C++ programming - For network projects: understanding
  of basic networking concepts ## Recommended Book To get started with C programming,
  I recommend this comprehensive book: [The C Programming Language](https://amzn.to/3F2Y1Zl)
  - A must-have resource for learning C programming fundamentals and best practices.
  ## Learning Path These projects are arranged in order of increasing complexity:
  1. Start with Tic-Tac-Toe for basic programming concepts 2. Move to SHA-512 for
  algorithm implementation 3. Try the UDP Server-Client for basic networking 4. Progress
  to HTTP Server and Chat System for more complex networking 5. Finally, explore Port
  Scanner and Ping for advanced networking concepts ## Contributing Feel free to:
  - Report bugs - Suggest improvements - Add new features - Create new projects -
  Improve documentation ## License This project is open source and available for learning
  purposes. ## Note Some network-related projects (Port Scanner, Ping) require root/administrator
  privileges to run due to the use of raw sockets. Always use these tools responsibly
  and only on networks you have permission to test."
