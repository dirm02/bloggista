indexed_content: "--> # 1. Genie Sim 3.0 Genie Sim is the simulation platform from
  AgiBot. It provides developers with a complete toolchain for environment reconstruction,
  scene generalization, data collection, and automated evaluation. Its core module,
  Genie Sim Benchmark is a standardized tool dedicated to establishing the most accurate
  and authoritative evaluation for embodied intelligence. The platform integrates
  3D reconstruction with visual generation to create a high-fidelity simulation environment.
  It pioneers LLM-driven technology to generate vast simulation scenes and evaluation
  configurations in minutes. The evaluation system covers 200+ tasks across 100,000+
  scenarios to establish a comprehensive capability profile for models. Genie Sim
  also opens over 10,000 hours synthetic dataset including real-world robot operation
  scenarios. The platform will significantly accelerate model development, reduce
  reliance on physical hardware, and empower innovation in embodied intelligence.
  Simulation assets, dataset, and code are fully open source. # 2. Features - **High-Fidelity
  Sim-Ready Assets**: 5,140 validated 3D assets covering five real-world operation
  fields: retail, industry, catering, home and office. [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/datasets/agibot_world/GenieSimAssets).
  - **3DGS-based Reconstruction Pipeline**: Integrate 3DGS-based reconstruction process
  with visual generative model to synthesize realistic simulation environment with
  high-precision meshes. [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/datasets/agibot_world/GenieSim3.0-Dataset).
  - **LLM-Driven Scene Generation**: Natural language-driven generation and generalization
  which instantly generates diverse simulation scenes through conversational interaction.
  - **Large-Scale Synthetic Dataset**: Over 10,000 hours open-source synthetic data
  across 200+ loco-manipulation tasks with multi-sensor streams, alongside multi-dimensional
  variations. - **Synthetic Data Generation**: Efficient toolkit for data collectoin
  with error-recovery mechanism, supporting both low-latency teleoperation and automated
  data programming. [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/datasets/agibot_world/GenieSim3.0-Dataset).
  - **Robust and Diverse Benchmark**: Provide 100,000+ simulation scenarios and use
  LLM to autonomously generate task instructions and evaluation configurations. Discrepancy
  between simulation and real-world test results is less than 10%. - **VLM-based Auto-Evaluation
  System**: Full-spectrum evaluation criteria to provide model's capability profile
  covering manipulation skills, cognitive comprehension and task complexity. - **Zero-Shot
  Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Model trained with our synthetic data exhibits zero-shot
  sim-to-real transfer capability with superior task success rate compared to model
  trained with real data. # 3. Updates - [1/7/2026] v3.0 - Update Isaac Sim to v5.1.0
