# AudioDeck

**A modern, self-hostable web spectrogram analyzer for your music library.**

## What is AudioDeck?

AudioDeck is a self-hosted web application that lets you visually analyze the audio quality of your music files. Think of it as a web-based, modern version of the classic Spek spectrogram analyzer.

Perfect for checking if your "high-quality" FLAC files are genuine or just upconverted low-quality MP3s.

## Why Do I Need This? The Visual Proof

Sometimes audio files aren't what they claim to be. A spectrogram reveals the truth:

| 🟢 **Real FLAC (Lossless)**                                                                               | 🔴 **Fake FLAC (MP3 > FLAC)**                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Spectrogram of a real FLAC file showing full frequency range](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dirm02/mystars/master/starred-readmes/casantosmu-audiodeck/.github/assets/spectrogram-real-flac.png) | ![Spectrogram of a fake FLAC file showing a 16kHz cutoff](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dirm02/mystars/master/starred-readmes/casantosmu-audiodeck/.github/assets/spectrogram-fake-flac.png) |
| Full frequency range up to 20-22 kHz                                                                      | Clear frequency cutoff around 16 kHz                                                                |
| Rich, detailed spectrum                                                                                   | "Brick wall" effect above cutoff                                                                    |

If you see a hard cutoff around 16 kHz, someone converted a low-quality MP3 to FLAC. Real lossless audio preserves the full frequency range.

## Key Features

- **🔋 Ultra Lightweight**: Go backend idles at ~15MB RAM
- **⚡ Zero Server Load**: Spectrograms generate 100% in your browser
- **🛡️ Secure by Design**: Path traversal resistant, read-only volume mounts
- **📱 Responsive**: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile
- **🐳 Docker Ready**: Minimal size image
- **🎵 Format Support**: MP3, FLAC, WAV

## Quick Start: Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file:

```yaml
services:
  audiodeck:
    image: casantosmu/audiodeck
    container_name: audiodeck
    user: "1000:1000"
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "4747:4747"
    volumes:
      - /path/to/your/music:/media:ro
```

Then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**Important**: Replace `/path/to/your/music` with the actual path to your music library on your server.

## 🎵 Support Artists
