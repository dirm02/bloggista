  ## Features ● Papers : Download ~78 million papers ● Database : ~390,000 ingested
  papers in Elastic Search ● Recommendations : Get similar papers based on content,
  or from same author, or same journal. ● Search : Search by title and/or author and/or
  date -- or date range -- (more details below) ● Deep Search : Search in the ingested
  papers content by entering a detailed description. ● Collections : Organize and
  save papers in collections. ● Notes : Highlight quotations from papers, and stick
  notes to them. ● AI Summary : Summarize papers using OpenAI key. And for advanced
  users : ● Ingestion engine to add more papers to the database. More details will
  be provided. ## Installation There are 2 ways to host Paperion locally: through
  Docker or manually. ### Docker Deployment ```sh wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blankresearch/Paperion/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml
  docker compose up ``` This will pull the frontend and backend in the same local
  network. The database is not yet available and will be provided soon. ### Manual
  Deployment 1. Host Elastic Search database on Docker ```sh The database is not yet
  available and will be provided soon. ``` 2. Download and run backend application
  ```sh git clone https://github.com/blankresearch/Paperion.git cd Paperion/backend
  pyenv install 3.10.7 pyenv local 3.10.7 python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
  && pip install -r requirements.txt uvicorn main:app --reload & ``` The app will
  start running locally, allowing you to access it via your browser at : http://localhost:8000
  or http://127.0.0.1:8000 3. Run frontend application ```sh cd Paperion/frontend/paperion
  npm run dev ``` The will launch frontend accessible via your browser at : http://localhost:3000
