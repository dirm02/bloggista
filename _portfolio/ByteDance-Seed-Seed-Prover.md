  page is used to store the Seed AI4Math group’s research projects, including Seed‑Prover
  1.5, Seed‑Prover and Delta‑Prover. - **Seed Prover 1.5** Seed-Prover 1.5 is our
  latest formal proving system. It can solve 88% of the problems in PutnamBench and
  11 out of the 12 competition problems from Putnam 2025. [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17260)
  - **Seed Prover** Seed‑Prover 1.0 is the system we officially participated with
  in the IMO 2025. [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23726) - **Delta prover** Delta‑Prover
  is a separate project focused on researching test time techniques for generating
  formal proofs. [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15225) ## Seed Prover IMO 2025
  Seed Prover 1.0 solved 4 out of 6 problems in IMO 2025 durint the context, with
  the following breakdown: - **Day 1**: Fully solved P2 (geometry) and P3 (number
  theory), fully solved P1 (combinatorics) after the competition. - **Day 2**: Fully
  solved P4 (number theory) and P5 (combinatorics / algebra) ### Details - P1 (combinatorics)
  [Lean](SeedProver/imo2025/p1.lean) : Fully proved after the competition, this is
  not scored by the IMO. - P2 (geometry) [NL](SeedProver/imo2025/p2_proof.pdf) : Generated
  and verified in 2 seconds using Seed-Geometry system - P3 (number theory) [NL](SeedProver/imo2025/p3_proof.pdf)
  [Lean](SeedProver/imo2025/p3.lean): Solved in 3 days, with a 2000-line formal proof
  - P4 (number theory) [NL](SeedProver/imo2025/p4_proof.pdf) [Lean](SeedProver/imo2025/p4.lean):
  Solved in 3 days, with a 4000-line formal proof - P5 (combinatorics / algebra) [NL](SeedProver/imo2025/p5_proof.pdf)
  [Lean](SeedProver/imo2025/p5.lean): Solved in 1 day, with a proof slightly different
  from known human solutions P1,3,4,5 are compiled under Lean v4.14.0. ## Citation
