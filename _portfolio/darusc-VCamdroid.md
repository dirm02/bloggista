  Networking Protocol VCamdroid utilizes the industry-standard **RTSP (Real-Time Streaming
  Protocol)** to ensure robust, low-latency video transmission between the Android
  device and the Windows client. 1. **Transport Layer:** * **Wi-Fi Connection:** The
  Windows client connects directly to the RTSP server running on the Android device
  over the local network. * **USB Connection:** To enable wired communication, the
  application uses **ADB Port Forwarding**. Since ADB only supports TCP forwarding,
  the RTSP stream is tunneled exclusively over **TCP** (interleaved RTSP). This creates
  a stable, high-bandwidth tunnel via `localhost` that bypasses network interference.
  2. **Stream Handling Libraries:** * **Server Side (Android):** Powered by the [RootEncoder](https://github.com/pedroSG94/RootEncoder)
  library. It handles the complex tasks of interfacing with the Android encoder, packetizing
  the video data into RTP packets, and managing the RTSP server session. * **Client
  Side (Windows):** Utilizes [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), the leading multimedia
  framework, to robustly demux the RTSP stream and decode the incoming video packets.

## Technical Architecture

### Networking Protocol
VCamdroid utilizes the industry-standard **RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol)** to ensure robust, low-latency video transmission between the Android device and the Windows client.

1.  **Transport Layer:**
    * **Wi-Fi Connection:** The Windows client connects directly to the RTSP server running on the Android device over the local network.
    * **USB Connection:** To enable wired communication, the application uses **ADB Port Forwarding**. Since ADB only supports TCP forwarding, the RTSP stream is tunneled exclusively over **TCP** (interleaved RTSP). This creates a stable, high-bandwidth tunnel via `localhost` that bypasses network interference.

### Video Pipeline
The pipeline is engineered for performance, offloading image processing to the Android GPU before compression to minimize latency and bandwidth.

1.  **Capture, Process & Encode (Android):**
    * **Capture:** Video frames are captured using the modern **Camera2 API**.
    * **Pre-Processing:** Raw frames are processed on the GPU using OpenGL. Operations like **Rotation**, **Mirroring (Flip)**, and **Color Correction** are applied here *before* encoding, ensuring the stream is "ready-to-display."
    * **Hardware Encoding:** The processed frames are passed to the device's hardware **MediaCodec** (supporting **H.264** or **H.265/HEVC**). This offloads compression from the CPU.
    * **Transmission:** **RootEncoder** encapsulates the encoded stream into RTP packets and transmits them over the active network connection.

2.  **Decode & Render (Windows):**
    * **Decoding:** The Windows client receives the RTSP stream and uses **FFmpeg** to decode the compressed H.264/H.265 frames into raw image data (YUV/RGB).
    * **Output:**
        * **UI Preview:** The decoded frame is rendered immediately to the application window for live monitoring.
        * **Virtual Device:** The frame is written to a ring buffer managed by the [Softcam](https://github.com/tshino/softcam) library. Softcam acts as the bridge between the user application and the system-registered DirectShow filter, allowing third-party apps (Zoom, Teams, OBS) to treat the stream as a physical webcam device.

#### 📱 Android App
1.  **Prerequisites:** Install the latest **Android Studio**.
2.  **Import:** Open the `android/` directory as a project.
3.  **Build:** Let Gradle sync and download dependencies.
    * *Core Dependency:* [RootEncoder](https://github.com/pedroSG94/RootEncoder) (handles RTSP/RTP packets).
4.  **Run:** Connect a physical Android device (emulators often lack necessary encoder hardware) and run the `app` module.

#### 💻 Windows Client
1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * **Visual Studio 2026** (with "Desktop development with C++" workload).
    * **vcpkg** for ```asio 1.32.0```, ```wxWidgets 3.3.1``` and ```ffmpeg 7.1.2```.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Use `vcpkg` to install the required libraries for **x64**:
    ```powershell
    vcpkg install wxwidgets:x64-windows ffmpeg:x64-windows
    vcpkg integrate install
    ```

3.  **Build Instructions:**
    * Build ```softcam```. [See](https://github.com/tshino/softcam?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-build-the-library) for instructions.
    * Open `windows/VCamdroid.sln`.
    * Set the configuration to **Release / x64** (x86 is not supported).
    * Build the solution.

4.  **Testing the Driver:**
    * The DirectShow filter (`softcam.dll`) must be registered to be visible to apps like OBS or Zoom.
    * Run `install.bat` as Administrator in your output directory, or manually register it via:
        ```cmd
        regsvr32 softcam.dll
        ```

## Troubleshooting

### App Crashes / "VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found"
If the application closes immediately or you see a system popup error regarding missing DLLs (like `VCRUNTIME140.dll` or `MSVCP140.dll`), your PC is missing the C++ runtime libraries.
* **Fix:** Download and install the [latest VC++ Redistributable (x64)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) from Microsoft.

### Connection Failed / Host Unreachable
If the Android app cannot connect to the Windows client:
1.  **Check Windows Firewall:** The firewall often blocks incoming video streams.
    * Search for **"Allow an app through Windows Firewall"** in the Start Menu.
    * Find `VCamdroid.exe` in the list and ensure both **Private** and **Public** boxes are checked.
2.  **Verify Network Visibility (Reverse Ping Test):**
    Sometimes the phone cannot see the PC. To verify:
    * Connect via USB (for the test command).
    * Open a terminal in the VCamdroid folder and run: `adb shell ping -c 4 <PC_IP_ADDRESS>`
    * If you see "100% packet loss" or "unreachable," your PC's firewall or router settings (AP Isolation) are blocking the connection.

### USB Connection not working
If the app does not detect your phone:
1.  **Check ADB Devices:**
    * Open a terminal in the VCamdroid folder.
    * Run: `adb devices`
    * **If list is empty:** Your cable is bad or [Universal ADB Drivers](https://adb.clockworkmod.com/) are missing.
    * **If "unauthorized":** Check your phone screen and tap "Allow" on the **"Allow USB Debugging?"** popup.
2.  **Kill Conflicting ADB Processes:**
    * Open **Task Manager** (`Ctrl + Shift + Esc`).
    * Search for `adb.exe` in the **Details** tab.
    * Right-click and select **End Task**, then restart VCamdroid.
