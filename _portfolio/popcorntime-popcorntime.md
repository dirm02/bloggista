  [l-ds]: https://discord.gg/c57nkpMzW6 This is a **complete rebuild of Popcorn Time**.
  Not a fork, not a patch - a fresh start with new goals and a clean foundation. This
  repository will be the home for ongoing development, documentation, and releases.
  #### What''s New - Modern, safer, and legal - Cross-platform: desktop, mobile, and
  TV - Open source and community driven - Weekly published databases for developers
  and researchers - [issue #3113](https://github.com/popcorntime/popcorntime/issues/3115)
  - Local media playback, not just links (soon) ## How Does Popcorn Time Differ? Other
  platforms like JustWatch or Reelgood act as directories. They show you where content
  might be, but they don''t let you do much beyond clicking through to a service.
  Popcorn Time is different: - The code is public, built by and for the community
  - Our catalog is released weekly as [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) datasets
  for developers and researchers - You can play your own files, not just follow links
  - Features and direction come from contributors, not corporate agendas - We share
  strong, growing databases with everyone - we''re not here to monetize discovery
  like the big guys ## Tech Popcorn Time is a [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)-based application.
  Its UI is written in [React](https://react.dev/) using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
  and its backend is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). ## Bugs and Feature
  Requests If you have a bug or feature request, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/popcorntime/popcorntime/issues/new/choose)
  ## Contributing If you''d like to help, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
  for guidelines on how to get started. If you want to skip right to getting the code
  to actually compile, take a look at the [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) file. ##
  Sponsors Popcorn Time is an MIT-licensed open source project with its ongoing development
  made possible entirely by the support of these awesome backers. If you''d like to

This is a **complete rebuild of Popcorn Time**. Not a fork, not a patch - a fresh start with new goals and a clean foundation. This repository will be the home for ongoing development, documentation, and releases.

## How Does Popcorn Time Differ?

Other platforms like JustWatch or Reelgood act as directories. They show you where content might be, but they don't let you do much beyond clicking through to a service.
