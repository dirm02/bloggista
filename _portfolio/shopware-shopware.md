  [feature tour](https://www.shopware.com/en/products/product-tour/) on the Shopware
  home page. From a developer's perspective, here are some highlights that make Shopware
  easy and fun to work with: ### Platform and Framework Shopware is primarily based
  on [Symfony](https://symfony.com/what-is-symfony) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
  It is a fully functional ecommerce platform, but it also serves as an **ecommerce
  framework**. Shopware is: - a ready-to-use [shopping cart system](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/getting-started).
  - a vendor dependency in your [flex project](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/installation/template).
  - [API-first](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/integrations-api). - [extensible
  through plugins](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/plugin-base-guide):
  - Harness the full power of Symfony by creating bundles and loading them as part
  of the application. - [extensible through apps](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/apps/app-base-guide):
  - A modern, lightweight but powerful way to add functionality, requiring very little
  Shopware-specific knowledge. - headless if you need it to be. ## Installation ###
  Production setup The easiest way to run a Shopware shop is by booking a commercial
  plan in the [Shopware cloud](https://www.shopware.com/en/shopware-cloud/), a fully
  managed setup, ready to use. The recommended way for on-premise shops is to install
  Shopware [through the flex template](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/installation/template).
  To unlock the full potential Shopware has to offer, [commercial plans](https://www.shopware.com/en/pricing/)
  are also available for on-premise. These plans enrich your shop with unique functionality,
  giving you an additional advantage over your competition. There is a list of [hosting
  partners](https://www.shopware.com/en/partner/hosting/), who offer a pre-installed
  shop, making your start a lot faster. We also provide a [web-based installer](https://www.shopware.com/en/download/),
  [installation instructions](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/installation/)
  on docs, and the [course](https://hub.shopware.com/learn/course/shopware-setup)
  walks you through the necessary steps. ### Code Contribution If you have decided
  to contribute code to Shopware and become a member of the Shopware community, We
  appreciate your hard"

## Project overview

To discover the features of Shopware and what sets us apart from other ecommerce systems, take the [feature tour](https://www.shopware.com/en/products/product-tour/) on the Shopware home page.

From a developer's perspective, here are some highlights that make Shopware easy and fun to work with:

### Platform and Framework

Shopware is primarily based on [Symfony](https://symfony.com/what-is-symfony) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
It is a fully functional ecommerce platform, but it also serves as an **ecommerce framework**.

Shopware is:

- a ready-to-use [shopping cart system](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/getting-started).
- a vendor dependency in your [flex project](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/installation/template).
- [API-first](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/integrations-api).
- [extensible through plugins](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/plugin-base-guide):
  - Harness the full power of Symfony by creating bundles and loading them as part of the application.
- [extensible through apps](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/apps/app-base-guide):
  - A modern, lightweight but powerful way to add functionality, requiring very little Shopware-specific knowledge.
- headless if you need it to be.

### Extending Shopware

There are already a lot of extensions available in the [Shopware store](https://store.shopware.com/).

After setting up [Shopware locally for development](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/installation), you can start with our extension guides in the documentation.

The preferred way of extending Shopware is through the [App System](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/apps/app-base-guide).
If the feature you want to implement needs direct access to the Shopware process and the database, you can also use the [plugin system](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/plugin-base-guide).    
You can find an [overview and differentiation in the documentation](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/concepts/extensions).
