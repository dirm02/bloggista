  complies with all applicable laws and regulations. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is
  a widely used wireless protocol that powers a huge variety of devices around you
  — from headphones, smartwatches, and fitness trackers to AirTags, IoT devices, game
  controllers, and even modern intimate gadgets. BLE devices communicate by broadcasting
  small packets of data, which can include device identifiers, metadata, and other
  information necessary for connectivity. These broadcasts, while essential for device
  functionality, can also be used to track your presence and movements. For example,
  a cheap pair of wireless headphones may expose a persistent identifier publicly.
  Anyone listening to BLE packets nearby — whether governments, companies, or malicious
  actors — could potentially use that information to track you without your consent.
  Fortunately, many modern devices implement privacy features in BLE to prevent tracking,
  such as randomized addresses and limited advertising. BLE Radar helps you distinguish
  between devices that protect your privacy and those that might be trackable. By
  analyzing BLE traffic in your surroundings, the app gives you insight into which
  devices are safe to use. Beyond analysis, BLE Radar can help protect you in real-time.
  The app can alert you when a suspicious device is nearby or if a device is moving
  with you over time, giving you an early warning against potential stalking or unwanted
  tracking. You can configure alerts based on device identifiers, types, or behaviors
  to fit your security needs. By making this app, the goal is to empower you with
  knowledge and control over the BLE devices in your environment. Understanding which
  devices are broadcasting trackable information and which are privacy-conscious allows
  you to make informed decisions about what you use, wear, and interact with daily.
  In general, the app is capable: * Scan, analyze and track Bluetooth devices around;
  * Create flexible filters for the radar; * Deep analysis of the scanned BLE devices,
  getting data from the available GATT services; * Gatt services Explorer; * Define
  the device type by metadata; * Define approximate distance to the device. This application
  does not share your personal data or geolocation, all work is offline."
