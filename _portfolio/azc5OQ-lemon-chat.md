  technical notes I made this communication system to be similar to tools such as
  Teamspeak or Mumble, which is evident from its interface. It supports optional voice
  chat if the admin enables audio in individual channel settings, and all messages—including
  text, images, and audio data—are end-to-end encrypted for both direct and channel
  communication. This chat does not rely solely on TLS/SSL and applies its own encryption
  on top if TLS/SSL is used, making it extremely difficult—even for the hosting admin—to
  view messages that do not belong to them. WebSocket is used for text and images,
  while WebRTC data channels are used for audio (only the data channel part is used;
  communication is client → server like WebSocket, so clients cannot leak IP addresses).
  The `client.html` contains everything embedded. It can be used like a regular `.exe`
  by clicking it, entering the IP address and port, and connecting to a server, or
  it can be packaged into an actual `.exe` using a tool like Electron if needed. Server
  should be easy to built, (if system has correct build tools installed) every dependency
  for building server is already in this repository, there are no extra C/C++ libraries
  to download. There is .bat file that can be launched to build it. ## Can the client.html
  file be embedded into website? # Yes. with following assumptions : - apache2 running
  on ubuntu - websocket port of choice: 1111 - stunnel used - websockets secure (WSS)
  port of choice: 1112 (set in stunnel configuration file) - certbot used - domain
  name "justsometestchat.com" steps to do it would be following - copy client.html
  to /var/www/html - apt install stunnel - apt install apache2 - install certbot (easiest
  way to get free certificate) - sudo certbot --apache - service apache2 start - vim
  /etc/stunnel.conf put this data in /etc/stunnel.conf [chatserver] accept = 0.0.0.0:1112
  connect = 127.0.0.1:1111 cert = /etc/letsencrypt/live/justsometestchat.com/cert.pem
  key = /etc/letsencrypt/live/justsometestchat.com/privkey.pem - run "stunnel" command
  in terminal. If command run with no error, server is probably set up correctly and
  accessible from https secured site. try viewwing https://justsometestchat.com/client.html
  in browser and test if everything works. The server will be accessible from both
  desktop and website ## Remote Port Forwarding Setup This guide shows how to make
  a local Windows server accessible from the public internet, even if it’s behind
  a router or firewall. The method uses a cheap VPS as a relay. --- ## Requirements
  - A VPS (1 CPU core, 500 MB RAM is enough) - SSH client (OpenSSH) - SSH key pair
  for authentication The VPS will act as a public access point for your local server
  traffic. --- ## Step 1: Connect via SSH with Remote Port Forwarding Run this command
  from your local Windows server: ```bash ssh -i /path/to/private_key -p 2245 -w 0:0
  \ -R 1234:localhost:1234 \ -R 3478:localhost:3478 \ -v root@VPS_IP_ADDRESS ``` ###
  Explanation of flags: - `-i /path/to/private_key` → SSH private key for authentication
  - `-p 2245` → SSH port on the VPS - `-w 0:0` → Creates a TUN/TAP interface (required
  for some setups) - `-R 1234:localhost:1234` → Forward local WebSocket port 1234
  to the VPS - `-R 3478:localhost:3478` → Forward STUN/UDP port 3478 (used for WebRTC
  data channels) - `-v` → Verbose mode for debugging `root@VPS_IP_ADDRESS` → Replace
  with your VPS root user and IP --- ### Notes **WebSocket Port (1234):** - Chosen
  by the admin when starting the server - Used for WebSocket connections **STUN/UDP
  Port (3478):** - Used for creating a non-peer-to-peer WebRTC data channel (UDP-based)
  - Optional if voice chat or WebRTC isn’t needed --- ✅ With this setup, your local
  server becomes accessible through the VPS without needing to configure router port
  forwarding. # Thanks to these projects and people for providing some of the source

## Can the client.html file be embedded into website?
# Yes. <br />
with following assumptions : <br />
- apache2 running on ubuntu <br />
- websocket port of choice: 1111 <br />
- stunnel used<br />
- websockets secure (WSS) port of choice: 1112 (set in stunnel configuration file) <br />
- certbot used <br />
- domain name "justsometestchat.com"<br />

steps to do it would be following
- copy client.html to /var/www/html <br />
- apt install stunnel<br />
- apt install apache2<br />
- install certbot (easiest way to get free certificate)<br />
- sudo certbot --apache<br />
- service apache2 start <br />
- vim /etc/stunnel.conf<br />

put this data in /etc/stunnel.conf<br />
[chatserver]<br />
accept = 0.0.0.0:1112 <br />
connect = 127.0.0.1:1111<br />
cert = /etc/letsencrypt/live/justsometestchat.com/cert.pem<br />
key = /etc/letsencrypt/live/justsometestchat.com/privkey.pem<br />


- run "stunnel" command in terminal. If command run with no error, server is probably set up correctly and accessible from https secured site.
  try viewwing https://justsometestchat.com/client.html in browser and test if everything works. The server will be accessible from both desktop and website <br />

## Remote Port Forwarding Setup

This guide shows how to make a local Windows server accessible from the public internet, even if it’s behind a router or firewall. The method uses a cheap VPS as a relay.

---

## Requirements

- A VPS (1 CPU core, 500 MB RAM is enough)
- SSH client (OpenSSH)
- SSH key pair for authentication

The VPS will act as a public access point for your local server traffic.

---

## Step 1: Connect via SSH with Remote Port Forwarding

Run this command from your local Windows server:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/private_key -p 2245 -w 0:0 \
    -R 1234:localhost:1234 \
    -R 3478:localhost:3478 \
    -v root@VPS_IP_ADDRESS
```
### Explanation of flags:

- `-i /path/to/private_key` → SSH private key for authentication  
- `-p 2245` → SSH port on the VPS  
- `-w 0:0` → Creates a TUN/TAP interface (required for some setups)  
- `-R 1234:localhost:1234` → Forward local WebSocket port 1234 to the VPS  
- `-R 3478:localhost:3478` → Forward STUN/UDP port 3478 (used for WebRTC data channels)  
- `-v` → Verbose mode for debugging  

`root@VPS_IP_ADDRESS` → Replace with your VPS root user and IP  

---

### Notes

**WebSocket Port (1234):**  
- Chosen by the admin when starting the server  
- Used for WebSocket connections  

**STUN/UDP Port (3478):**  
- Used for creating a non-peer-to-peer WebRTC data channel (UDP-based)  
- Optional if voice chat or WebRTC isn’t needed  

---

✅ With this setup, your local server becomes accessible through the VPS without needing to configure router port forwarding.
