## 🔐 Recovery Without the App

If you need to recover or spend Bitcoin from your keyshares without using the mobile app, you can use the command-line recovery tools. This is useful if:
- The mobile app is unavailable or not working
- You need to recover funds from keyshare backups
- You want to use the wallet from a desktop environment

### Quick Recovery Guide

Bold Wallet provides cross-platform CLI tools for recovering and spending Bitcoin from keyshare backups:

1. **`bold-spend` binary** (Recommended) - Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
2. **`spend-bitcoin.sh` script** - Unix/Linux/macOS only

### What You Need

- **Keyshare files**: Both keyshare backup files (`.share` files from mobile app or `.ks` files)
- **Passphrases**: If your keyshares are encrypted
- **Network info**: Mainnet or testnet
- **Derivation path**: BIP32 path for your wallet address type

### Quick Example

```bash
# Navigate to BBMTLib directory
cd BBMTLib

# Build the recovery binary
./build-bold-spend.sh

# Preview transaction (estimate fee)
./bin/bold-spend-darwin-arm64 \
  --to-address <recipient_address> \
  --amount-sats <amount> \
  --network testnet3 \
  --mempool-url https://mempool.space/testnet/api \
  --derivation-path "m/84'/1'/0'/0/0" \
  --address-type p2wpkh \
  --keyshare1 "KeyShare1.Dec19.2025.1257.share" \
  --keyshare2 "KeyShare2.Dec19.2025.1257.share" \
  --passphrase1 "your-passphrase-1" \
  --passphrase2 "your-passphrase-2" \
  --preview

# Send transaction (remove --preview and add --fee-sats)
./bin/bold-spend-darwin-arm64 \
  --to-address <recipient_address> \
  --amount-sats <amount> \
  --fee-sats <estimated_fee> \
  --network testnet3 \
  --mempool-url https://mempool.space/testnet/api \
  --derivation-path "m/84'/1'/0'/0/0" \
  --address-type p2wpkh \
  --keyshare1 "KeyShare1.Dec19.2025.1257.share" \
  --keyshare2 "KeyShare2.Dec19.2025.1257.share" \
  --passphrase1 "your-passphrase-1" \
  --passphrase2 "your-passphrase-2"
```
