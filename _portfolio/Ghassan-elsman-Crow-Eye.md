## Vision: Forensics for Everyone

### Our Mission

Crow-Eye mission is to put the truth of what happened on a computer into the hands of every person — not just experts. We believe digital forensics should be accessible to everyone, regardless of technical background.

**Empowering Everyone**

Whether you're a parent worried about what your teen downloaded, a senior who thinks they might have been scammed, or just someone wondering why their PC feels "off," Crow-Eye analyzes your PC, understands the deep forensic traces Windows leaves behind, and explains them in plain, trustworthy language.

**The Future: Crow-Eye Assistant ("Eye")**

Soon you'll simply ask Crow-Eye Assistant (we call it "Eye"):
- *"Was anyone using my laptop while I was away last weekend?"*
- *"Which program has been secretly connecting to the internet?"*

Eye answers instantly, shows you the proof, and never sends your data anywhere.

### For Digital Forensics Professionals

**Faster, Smarter DFIR**
- Advanced parsing of Windows artifacts
- Detection of evasion techniques
- Proof-of-execution and file activity tracing
- One-click proof-of-execution

## 🧩 Correlation Engine

The **Crow-Eye Correlation Engine** is a correlation system designed to collect and correlate various artifacts into meaningful connections. It works with default correlation rules out of the box, and also allows users to build custom rules tailored to their specific investigation needs.

The engine finds temporal and semantic relationships between different types of forensic artifacts, helping investigators discover connections between events that occurred on a system by correlating data from multiple sources.

**Universal Data Import**: The Correlation Engine can take output from **any forensic tool** in CSV, JSON, or SQLite format and convert it into a Feather database. This means you can correlate data from third-party tools (Plaso, Autopsy, Volatility, etc.) with Crow-Eye's native artifacts, creating a unified correlation analysis across all your forensic data sources.

### ✅ Production Status

- **🎨 Professional UI**: Cyberpunk-styled interface with timeline visualization

### System Architecture

The Correlation Engine consists of four main components:

#### 1. 🗄️ Feathers (Data Normalization)

**Purpose**: Transform raw forensic artifacts into a standardized, queryable format.

**What They Are**:
- SQLite databases containing normalized forensic artifact data
- Each feather represents one artifact type (e.g., Prefetch, ShimCache, Event Logs)
- Standardized schema with metadata for efficient querying
- **Universal format** that accepts data from any forensic tool

**How They Work**:
```
Any Tool Output → Feather Builder → Normalized Feather Database
(CSV/JSON/SQLite)                   (SQLite with standard schema)

Examples:
- Plaso CSV → Feather Builder → timeline.db
- Autopsy JSON → Feather Builder → autopsy_artifacts.db
- Volatility CSV → Feather Builder → memory_artifacts.db
- Custom Tool Output → Feather Builder → custom.db
```

**Key Features**:
- **Multi-source import**: SQLite databases, CSV files, JSON files from any tool
- Automatic column mapping and data type detection
- Timestamp normalization to ISO format
- Data validation and error handling
- Optimized indexes for fast correlation

**Supported Import Formats**:
- **CSV**: Any CSV file with headers (from Plaso, Excel exports, custom scripts, etc.)
- **JSON**: Flat or nested JSON from any forensic tool
- **SQLite**: Direct import from other SQLite databases

**Example**:
```
prefetch.db (Feather)
├── feather_metadata (artifact type, source, record count)
├── prefetch_data (executable_name, path, last_executed, hash)
└── Indexes (timestamp, name, path)
```

#### 2. 🎯 Wings (Correlation Rules)

**Purpose**: Define which artifacts to correlate and how to correlate them.

**What They Are**:
- JSON/YAML configuration files that specify correlation rules
- Define time windows, minimum matches, and feather relationships
- Reusable across different cases and datasets

**Key Components**:
- **Correlation Rules**: Time window, minimum matches, anchor priority
- **Feather Specifications**: Which feathers to correlate, weights, requirements
- **Filters**: Optional time period or identity filters

**Example Wing**:
```json
{
  "wing_id": "execution-proof",
  "wing_name": "Execution Proof",
  "correlation_rules": {
    "time_window_minutes": 5,
    "minimum_matches": 2,
    "anchor_priority": ["Prefetch", "SRUM", "AmCache"]
  },
  "feathers": [
    {"feather_id": "prefetch", "weight": 0.4},
    {"feather_id": "shimcache", "weight": 0.3},
    {"feather_id": "amcache", "weight": 0.3}
  ]
}
```

#### 3. ⚙️ Engines (Correlation Strategies)

**Purpose**: Execute correlation logic to find relationships between artifacts.

The Correlation Engine offers two distinct strategies:

##### Time-Window Scanning Engine

**Best For**: Time-based artifact analysis, systematic temporal correlation, production environments

**How It Works**:
1. Scan through time systematically from year 2000 in fixed intervals
2. For each time window, collect records from all feathers
3. Apply semantic field matching and weighted scoring
4. Prevent duplicates using MatchSet tracking
5. Return correlation matches with confidence scores

**Complexity**: O(N log N) where N = number of records (indexed timestamp queries)

**Key Features**:
- Systematic temporal analysis with fixed time windows
- Universal timestamp format support with robust indexing
- Batch processing for high performance (2,567 windows/second)
- Memory-efficient with intelligent caching
- Production-ready for time-based investigations

##### Identity-Based Correlation Engine

**Best For**: Large datasets (> 1,000 records), production environments, identity tracking

**How It Works**:
1. Extract and normalize identity information from all records
2. Group records by identity (application/file)
3. Create temporal anchors within each identity cluster
4. Classify evidence as primary, secondary, or supporting
5. Return identity-centric correlation results

**Complexity**: O(N log N) where N = number of records

**Key Features**:
- Identity extraction with 40+ field patterns per type
- Multi-feather identity grouping
- Temporal anchor clustering
- Streaming mode for large datasets (> 5,000 anchors)
- Constant memory usage with streaming
- Identity filtering support

**Engine Selection**:
- **Time-based analysis**: Use Time-Window Scanning Engine (production-ready, O(N log N))
- **Identity tracking**: Use Identity-Based Engine (production-ready, O(N log N))
- Both engines are optimized for large datasets with indexed queries

#### 4. 🔄 Pipelines (Workflow Orchestration)

**Purpose**: Automate complete analysis workflows from feather creation to result generation.

**What They Are**:
- Orchestration layer that ties everything together
- Automate feather creation, wing execution, and report generation
- Support for multiple wings and complex workflows

**Pipeline Workflow**:
1. **Load Configuration**: Read pipeline config with engine type, wings, feathers
2. **Create Engine**: Use EngineSelector to instantiate appropriate engine
3. **Execute Wings**: Run each wing against specified feathers
4. **Collect Results**: Aggregate correlation matches from all wings
5. **Generate Reports**: Save results to database and JSON files
6. **Display Results**: Present in GUI with filtering and visualization

**Example Pipeline**:
```json
{
  "pipeline_name": "Investigation Pipeline",
  "engine_type": "identity_based",
  "wings": [
    {"wing_id": "execution-proof"},
    {"wing_id": "file-access"}
  ],
  "feathers": [
    {"feather_id": "prefetch", "database_path": "data/prefetch.db"},
    {"feather_id": "srum", "database_path": "data/srum.db"},
    {"feather_id": "eventlogs", "database_path": "data/eventlogs.db"}
  ],
  "filters": {
    "time_period_start": "2024-01-01T00:00:00",
    "time_period_end": "2024-12-31T23:59:59"
  }
}
```

### How It All Works Together

```
1. Data Preparation
   Raw Forensic Data → Feather Builder → Feather Databases

2. Configuration
   Wing Configs + Feather References → Pipeline Config

3. Execution
   Pipeline Executor → Engine Selector → Correlation Engine

4. Correlation
   Engine loads Feathers + applies Wing rules → Correlation Results

5. Visualization
   Results Database → Results Viewer GUI
```

### Example Use Case: Finding Execution Proof

**Scenario**: Prove that `malware.exe` was executed on a system

**Step 1: Create Feathers**
```bash
# Import Prefetch, ShimCache, and AmCache data
python -m correlation_engine.feather.feather_builder
```

**Step 2: Create Wing**
```json
{
  "wing_id": "malware-execution",
  "correlation_rules": {
    "time_window_minutes": 5,
    "minimum_matches": 2
  },
  "feathers": ["prefetch", "shimcache", "amcache"]
}
```

**Step 3: Execute Pipeline**
```python
from correlation_engine.pipeline import PipelineExecutor

executor = PipelineExecutor(pipeline_config)
results = executor.execute()
```

**Step 4: View Results**
```
Identity: malware.exe
  Anchor 1 (2024-01-15 10:30:00):
    ✓ Prefetch: malware.exe executed at 10:30:00
    ✓ ShimCache: malware.exe modified at 10:30:15
    ✓ AmCache: malware.exe installed at 10:29:45
  
  Conclusion: Execution proven with 3 corroborating artifacts
```
