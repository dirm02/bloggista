  and open source. # Why not 10" rack? 10" racks are beautiful, I built several for
  different use cases and I love them. But I needed something different: * Something
  considerably smaller than common 10" racks and while it can support almost all devices
  supported by 10" format. * Something square, so any panel/tray can be placed any
  side. To provide flexibility for cooling, cabling, HMI. * Something fully 3D printable.
  Couple of PLA rolls are much cheaper than most 10" rack solutions. M3 screws are
  also much cheaper than M6 rack screws while looking more proportional and being
  able to support the weight of any equipment listed below. * Something fun to design
  and build. # Components ### Qucik Guide - *Col:* The vertical columns with holes
  that holds M3 nuts and/or 8x3 magnets. - *Cap:* The parts on top and botton that
  holds 4-columns together. - *Tray:* The parts that hold various devices horizontally.
  - *Panel:* To cover rack slots vertically with various small tweaks like fans, screens,
  buttons, knobs or nothing. - *Mini-Tray:* System to keep small devices like Raspberry
  Pi or 2.5" SATA drives. Has 7 mini slots in 3.5U of space while allowing air flow
  vertically or from behind. | File Name | Status | Description/Notes | |-|-|-| |

| Extension-ITX-1U | NOT TESTED | This part allows you to put a MiniITX board on top of the Microlab. It's mainly intended for N100 MiniITX boards with many SATA ports from Aliexpress but any board should work fine. Select the height of the extension depending on the needed additional space and keep your cooler height in mind. Any panel/tray/cap should be compatible with the columns here. |

# Materials
* M3x10 (or M3x12) screws and nuts (How many: Min 32 screw-nut pairs if all side panels are magnetic, 112 pairs for full screw-nut 6U build, I use ~160-180 pairs for my 6+4 extended setup combined with magnetic panels)
* [Optional] 8x3mm Magnets for magnetic panels, 4 magnets/1U

# Notes
* All side panels have the same dimension standards, so any panel/tray can be attached to any side. Just make sure to put magnets/nuts behind the needed spots before assembling everything for a better general use experience.
* Make sure all magnets have consistent polarity, so any magnetic panel can be placed at anywhere with magnets.
* Please glue your magnets to places and wait for glue to dry before attaching magnetic panels/trays.
* Raspberry Pi 3 users can use Pi 5 trays with no problems. The front face is virtually identical. Also, ASUS Tinkerboard 2 is tested and fully compatible.
* Technically this system can hold a Mini-ITX motherboard with numerous 2.5" drives in mini-tray(s) and a SFX/SFX-L PSU.
* Cabling for the power switches can be tricky for Raspberry Pi. Powering from GPIO can be risky due to by-passing the 5V regulator.
* The whole thing can be used horizontally. Just assemble the feet to the cap screw points and plan your cooling accordingly.

# TODO
- [ ] 3.5" HDD tray
- [ ] PCI card support for ITX extension (maybe as a tray to use with PCI riser cable)
- [ ] Trays for common 2.5G network switch models 
- [ ] Trays for more mini PC models
- [ ] M3 insert version for columns
- [ ] Handles to carry it around
