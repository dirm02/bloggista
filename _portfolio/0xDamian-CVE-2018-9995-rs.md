## Watching Live Feeds

To watch live feeds from compromised CCTV cameras, you need a browser that supports ActiveX. 
All modern browsers have dropped support for ActiveX, so one of the few ways to watch live feeds is to use Internet Explorer.
You can either install a Windows 7 VM or use "IE Mode" in Edge on Windows 10/11.
