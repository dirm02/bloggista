## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- **Docker** (20.10+) and **Docker Compose** (2.0+) installed
- **Git** for cloning the repository
- **2GB+ RAM** available for Docker containers
- **Port 80/443** (HTTPS) or **8080** (HTTP) available

> **💡 New to Docker?** See [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your platform.

### Option 1: Docker with HTTPS (Recommended for Production)

Get TimeTracker running in under 2 minutes with automatic HTTPS:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/drytrix/TimeTracker.git
cd TimeTracker

# 2. Create your environment file from the template
cp env.example .env

# 3. IMPORTANT: Edit .env and set a strong SECRET_KEY
# Generate one with: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
# Also set your timezone (TZ) and currency (CURRENCY)
nano .env  # or use any text editor

# 4. Start with Docker Compose (includes HTTPS via nginx with self-signed cert)
docker-compose up -d

# 5. Access at https://localhost
# Your browser will warn about the self-signed certificate - that's normal
# Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to localhost" to continue
```

**First login creates the admin account** — just enter your username!

**📖 See the complete setup guide:** [`docs/admin/configuration/DOCKER_COMPOSE_SETUP.md`](docs/admin/configuration/DOCKER_COMPOSE_SETUP.md)

**🔧 Troubleshooting:**
- **Port already in use?** Change ports in `docker-compose.yml` or stop conflicting services
- **Docker won't start?** See [Docker Startup Troubleshooting](docs/admin/configuration/DOCKER_STARTUP_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
- **CSRF errors?** See [CSRF Troubleshooting](docs/admin/security/CSRF_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
- **Database connection issues?** See [Database Troubleshooting](docker/TROUBLESHOOTING_DB_CONNECTION.md)

### Option 2: Docker with Plain HTTP (Development/Testing)

For local development or testing without HTTPS:

```bash
# 1. Clone and navigate to the repository
git clone https://github.com/drytrix/TimeTracker.git
cd TimeTracker

# 2. Use the example compose file that exposes HTTP directly
docker-compose -f docker-compose.example.yml up -d

# 3. Access at http://localhost:8080
```

**Note:** This setup uses HTTP only. For production, use Option 1 with HTTPS.

### Option 3: Quick Test with SQLite

Want to try it out without any configuration? Perfect for quick testing:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/drytrix/TimeTracker.git
cd TimeTracker

# 2. Start with the local test configuration (uses SQLite, no PostgreSQL)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local-test.yml up --build

# 3. Access at http://localhost:8080
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No database setup required
- ✅ No .env file configuration needed
- ✅ Perfect for quick testing and evaluation
- ⚠️ **Note:** SQLite is not recommended for production use

## 🐳 Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
# Start with HTTPS (recommended)
docker-compose up -d

# Or use plain HTTP for development
docker-compose -f docker-compose.example.yml up -d
```

### Production Deployment

#### Option 1: Build from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/drytrix/TimeTracker.git
cd TimeTracker

# Configure your .env file
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with production settings:
# - Set a strong SECRET_KEY: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
# - Configure TZ (timezone) and CURRENCY
# - Set PostgreSQL credentials (POSTGRES_PASSWORD, etc.)

# Start the application
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Option 2: Use Pre-built Images
```bash
# Use the remote compose file with published images
docker-compose -f docker-compose.remote.yml up -d
```

> **⚠️ Security Note:** Always set a unique `SECRET_KEY` in production! See [CSRF Configuration](docs/admin/security/CSRF_CONFIGURATION.md) for details.

### Raspberry Pi Deployment
TimeTracker runs perfectly on Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB+ RAM):
```bash
# Same Docker commands work on ARM architecture
docker-compose up -d
```

### HTTPS Configuration

#### Automatic HTTPS (Easiest)
```bash
# Uses self-signed certificates (generated automatically)
docker-compose up -d
# Access at https://localhost (accept browser warning)
```

#### Manual HTTPS with mkcert (No Browser Warnings)
```bash
# Use mkcert for locally-trusted certificates
docker-compose -f docker-compose.https-mkcert.yml up -d
```
**📖 See [HTTPS Setup Guide](docs/admin/security/README_HTTPS.md) for detailed instructions**

### Monitoring & Analytics
```bash
# Deploy with full monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)
docker-compose up -d
# Grafana: http://localhost:3000
# Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
```

**📖 See [Deployment Guide](docs/admin/configuration/DOCKER_PUBLIC_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions**  
**📖 See [Docker Compose Setup](docs/admin/configuration/DOCKER_COMPOSE_SETUP.md) for configuration options**

## 🔧 Configuration

TimeTracker is highly configurable through environment variables. For a comprehensive list and recommended values, see:

- [`docs/admin/configuration/DOCKER_COMPOSE_SETUP.md`](docs/admin/configuration/DOCKER_COMPOSE_SETUP.md)
- [`env.example`](env.example)

Common settings:

```bash
# Timezone and locale
TZ=America/New_York
CURRENCY=USD

# Timer behavior
SINGLE_ACTIVE_TIMER=true
IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=30
ROUNDING_MINUTES=1

# User management
# Note: Only the first username in ADMIN_USERNAMES is auto-created during initialization.
# Additional usernames must self-register (if ALLOW_SELF_REGISTER=true) or be created manually.
ADMIN_USERNAMES=admin,manager
ALLOW_SELF_REGISTER=false

# Security (production)
SECRET_KEY=your-secure-random-key
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true
```

## 📊 Analytics & Telemetry

TimeTracker includes **optional** analytics and monitoring features to help improve the application and understand how it's being used. All analytics features are:

- ✅ **Disabled by default** — You must explicitly opt-in
- ✅ **Privacy-first** — No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected
- ✅ **Self-hostable** — Run your own analytics infrastructure
- ✅ **Transparent** — All data collection is documented

### What We Collect (When Enabled)

#### 1. **Structured Logs** (Always On, Local Only)
- Request logs and error messages stored **locally** in `logs/app.jsonl`
- Used for troubleshooting and debugging
- **Never leaves your server**

#### 2. **Prometheus Metrics** (Always On, Self-Hosted)
- Request counts, latency, and performance metrics
- Exposed at `/metrics` endpoint for your Prometheus server
- **Stays on your infrastructure**

#### 3. **Error Monitoring** (Optional - Sentry)
- Captures uncaught exceptions and performance issues
- Helps identify and fix bugs quickly
- **Opt-in:** Set `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable

#### 4. **Product Analytics** (Optional - PostHog)
- Tracks feature usage and user behavior patterns with advanced features:
  - **Person Properties**: Role, auth method, login history
  - **Feature Flags**: Gradual rollouts, A/B testing, kill switches
  - **Group Analytics**: Segment by version, platform, deployment
  - **Rich Context**: Browser, device, environment on every event
- **Opt-in:** Set `POSTHOG_API_KEY` environment variable
- See [POSTHOG_ADVANCED_FEATURES.md](docs/admin/monitoring/POSTHOG_ADVANCED_FEATURES.md) for complete guide

#### 5. **Installation Telemetry** (Optional, Anonymous)
- Sends anonymous installation data via PostHog with:
  - Anonymized fingerprint (SHA-256 hash, cannot be reversed)
  - Application version
  - Platform information
- **No PII:** No IP addresses, usernames, or business data
- **Opt-in:** Set `ENABLE_TELEMETRY=true` and `POSTHOG_API_KEY` environment variables

### How to Enable Analytics

```bash
# Enable Sentry error monitoring (optional)
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn@sentry.io/project-id
SENTRY_TRACES_RATE=0.1  # 10% sampling for performance traces

# Enable PostHog product analytics (optional)
POSTHOG_API_KEY=your-posthog-api-key
POSTHOG_HOST=https://app.posthog.com

# Enable anonymous telemetry (optional, uses PostHog)
ENABLE_TELEMETRY=true
TELE_SALT=your-unique-salt
APP_VERSION=1.0.0
```

### Self-Hosting Analytics

You can self-host all analytics services for complete control:

```bash
# Use docker-compose with monitoring profile
docker-compose --profile monitoring up -d
```

This starts:
- **Prometheus** — Metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana** — Visualization dashboards
- **Loki** (optional) — Log aggregation
- **Promtail** (optional) — Log shipping

### Privacy & Data Protection

> **Telemetry**: TimeTracker can optionally send anonymized usage data to help improve the product (errors, feature usage, install counts). All telemetry is **opt-in**. No personal data is collected. To disable telemetry, set `ENABLE_TELEMETRY=false` or simply don't set the environment variable (disabled by default).

**What we DON'T collect:**
- ❌ Email addresses or usernames
- ❌ IP addresses
- ❌ Project names or descriptions
- ❌ Time entry notes or client data
- ❌ Any personally identifiable information (PII)

**Your rights:**
- 📥 **Access**: View all collected data
- ✏️ **Rectify**: Correct inaccurate data
- 🗑️ **Erase**: Delete your data at any time
- 📤 **Export**: Export your data in standard formats

**📖 See [Privacy Policy](docs/privacy.md) for complete details**  
**📖 See [Analytics Documentation](docs/analytics.md) for configuration**  
**📖 See [Events Schema](docs/events.md) for tracked events**
