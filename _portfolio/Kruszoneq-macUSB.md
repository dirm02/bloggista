  been easier! [](https://kruszoneq.github.io/macUSB/) **macUSB** is a one-click tool
  that transforms your modern Mac (Apple Silicon) into a service machine capable of
  reviving older Apple computers. --- ## ☕ Support If you’d like to support the project,
  here’s a simple way. ## \U0001F5BC️ Preview ## \U0001F680 About the Project With
  Apple's transition to its own silicon (M1, M2, M3...), preparing installation media
  for older Intel- and PowerPC-based computers has become a challenge. Many people
  encounter Terminal errors, issues with expired certificates in old installers, or
  simply a lack of compatibility with system tools. **macUSB solves this problem.**
  The application automates the entire process of creating a bootable USB drive. You
  don't need to search for commands online, worry about disk formatting, or manually
  fix validation errors in old installation files. ### What do you gain? * **Legacy
  Support:** The ability to create installers for systems over a decade old (e.g.,
  OS X Lion) directly on the latest Mac on Apple Silicon. * **Time Saving:** The app
  detects the system version in the **`.dmg`**, **`.iso`**, **`.cdr`** or **`.app`**
  file, formats the drive, and copies files automatically. * **Auto Fixes:** For certain
  systems (e.g., High Sierra/Mojave), the app automatically applies necessary fixes
  so the installer works despite expired Apple certificates. * **PowerPC Revival:**
  The app formats USB drives to the Apple Partition Map (APM) scheme required by PowerPC
  Macs and transfers the installer directly from **`.iso`**, **`.cdr`** or **`.dmg`**
  files. This allows for installation without the need for physical CDs/DVDs or FireWire
  drives. > \U0001F4D6 **Guide:** [Step-by-step: Booting from USB on PowerPC Macs

  * **Security:** Starting with version **v1.1.2**, the application is officially
  **notarized by Apple**. This guarantees that the software is free from malicious
  code and ensures a seamless, secure first launch on macOS without requiring any
  extra security workarounds. --- **Fun Fact:** The application was created using
  the \"Vibe Coding\" method. Every single function has been rigorously verified for
  correct operation to ensure full stability. This project proves that programming
  barriers (even cross-architectural ones) can be overcome with determination and
  AI support while maintaining the highest standards of code quality. --- ## ⚙️ Requirements
  ### Host Computer (where you run the app): * **Processor:** Both Apple Silicon and
  Intel are supported. * **System:** **macOS Sonoma 14.6** or newer. * **Storage:**
  Minimum of **15 GB** of free disk space is required **to create the installers**.
  ### USB Drives & External Storage * **Capacity:** A minimum of **16 GB** is required.
  * **Speed:** USB 3.0 or newer is highly recommended for faster installation times.
  * **External Drives (HDD/SSD):** By default, only USB flash drives are detected
  for safety. To use external disks, enable **Options** → **Enable external drives
  support**. ### Installation Files: The program supports **`.dmg`**, **`.cdr`** and
  **`.iso`** disk images, as well as raw **`.app`** installer files. > **Pro Tip:**
  Where to get valid files? > * **OS X 10.7 - 10.8** and **10.10 – macOS 26:** The
  most convenient solution is downloading via the free app **[Mist](https://github.com/ninxsoft/Mist)**.
  > * **OS X 10.9:** The recommended source is **[Mavericks Forever](https://mavericksforever.com/)**
  (macUSB support was developed based on the image from this site). > * **Mac OS X
  10.4 – 10.6 (Intel):** Disk images are available on the **Internet Archive**. >
  * **Mac OS X 10.4 – 10.5 (PowerPC):** Images for PPC architecture can be found on
  **Macintosh Garden**. --- ## \U0001F4BF Supported Versions The table lists systems
