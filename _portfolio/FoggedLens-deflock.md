## Purpose

I created this project after noticing the mass deployment of ALPRs in cities, towns, and even rural areas in the recent years. It's a massive threat to privacy, and this projects helps shed a light on this issue as ALPRs continue to be deployed to thousands of cities across the US and possibly beyond.

## What it Does

### View ALPRs on a Map
Uses OpenStreetMap data to populate a map with crowdsourced locations of ALPRs, along with their type and direction they face.

### Report ALPRs
Provides OSM tags for easy reporting of ALPRs based on brand on OSM's editing site. Eventually, this will be a native feature of the site.

### Learn About ALPRs
See photos of common ALPRs and learn about their capabilities.
