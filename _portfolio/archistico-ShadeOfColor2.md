﻿# 🌈 ShadeOfColor

**Turn any file into an image, and back again.**  
A simple cross-platform tool to hide files inside PNG images.  

---

## ✨ What is ShadeOfColor?

Have you ever wanted to:

- 📧 Send a file by email that the provider does not allow?  
- ☁️ Store restricted file types on cloud services that only accept images?  
- 🕵️ Add an extra layer of privacy when sharing files publicly?  
- ✒ Are you a journalist in a totalitarian state and need to release a file?
- 🔒 Exfiltrate data into systems that monitor suspicious files? 

With ShadeOfColor, you can **convert any file into an image** (`-crypt`) and later **recover the original file** (`-decrypt`).  
The output looks like a normal PNG, but it actually carries your data inside its pixels.
