  that helps you monitor and manage CVEs efficiently. It aggregates vulnerabilities
  from multiple sources (MITRE, NVD, RedHat, Vulnrichment...) and lets you filter,
  track, and organize them by vendor, product, severity, and more. You can subscribe
  to products, receive alerts, analyze changes, and collaborate with your team — all
  through a simple and powerful interface. Assign members to CVEs to track progress
  (e.g. under analysis, risk accepted) and keep everyone aligned. ## Key Features
  ### \U0001F4DA Explore, Filter and Organize - Filter CVEs by vendor, product, CVSS,
  KEV, EPSS, CWE, publication date, and more. - Subscribe to vendors and products,
  and organize your monitoring with projects and organizations. - Save complex filters
  as reusable Views. ### \U0001F516 Tag, Prioritize and Get Notified - Classify CVEs
  with custom tags (e.g. unread, critical, assigned-to-dev). - Assign users and statuses
  to CVEs to track progress (under analysis, risk accepted, etc.). - Receive alerts
  instantly via email or webhook (Slack and Teams coming soon). ### \U0001F501 Track
  Changes and Generate Reports - Access the complete change history of CVEs: scores,
  descriptions, references, etc. - Generate daily reports by project to stay ahead.
  - Get AI-powered report summaries to see priorities and immediate actions at a glance.
  ### \U0001F4CA Customize Your Dashboard - Create multiple dashboards to organize
  your work the way you want. - Build your own dashboard with widgets like \"CVEs
  per project\" or \"Recent Reports\". - Drag, resize, and save layouts per organization.
  ### ✨ OpenCVE Enrichment - Our in-house AI analyzes every new CVE and extracts associated
  vendors and products, even when they weren’t explicitly mentioned by the CVE authors.
  - So users can subscribe and filter by vendor/product with confidence and never
  miss a relevant vulnerability. ## How to Use OpenCVE ### ✅ SaaS (Recommended) Use
