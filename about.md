### Who I am

I’m MoMo, a builder obsessed with **giving people control over their own software** – not locking them into someone else’s platform.

I’ve spent years experimenting with stacks for **mobile apps, desktop tools, and web applications**, and turning that experience into ready‑to‑ship products and repeatable services.

If you want to **own your infrastructure, your data, and your roadmap** – this place is for you.

### What I help you do

- **Launch your own SaaS or internal tools**
  - From idea → prototype → production
  - Opinionated architecture that stays simple to maintain

- **Host your own apps instead of renting them**
  - Self‑hosted alternatives to popular SaaS tools
  - Setup on your own VPS, cloud account, or home lab

- **Ship cross‑platform products**
  - Web apps (marketing sites, dashboards, admin panels)
  - Mobile apps (Android / iOS, using modern cross‑platform stacks)
  - Desktop apps (for power users, offline workflows, or installers)

- **Automate the boring stuff**
  - DevOps and CI/CD pipelines
  - Backups, monitoring, and security basics baked in

My goal is simple: **you keep ownership, I handle the complexity.**

### How we can work together

I offer a mix of:

- **Done‑for‑you services** – I design, build, and deploy your app or stack.
- **Digital products & templates** – pre‑built starters you can install, customize, and grow.
- **Coaching & technical guidance** – if you’re building yourself and just need a senior engineer to keep you unblocked.

Whether you’re:

- A **founder** wanting to launch a product without hiring a full team  
- A **maker** wanting more reliability and less vendor lock‑in  
- A **business** wanting internal tools that actually fit your workflow  

…I can help you move from “idea and bookmarks” to a **running system you control**.
